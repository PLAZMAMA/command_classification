"No, actually, it was a little of both. Sometimes when a disease is in all the magazines and all the news shows, it's only natural that you think you have it."
Where's Mr. Bergstrom?
I don't know. Although I'd sure like to talk to him. He didn't touch my lesson plan. What did he teach you?
That life is worth living.
"The polls will be open from now until the end of recess. Now, just in case any of you have decided to put any thought into this, we'll have our final statements. Martin?"
I don't think there's anything left to say.
Victory party under the slide!
Mr. Bergstrom! Mr. Bergstrom!
"Hey, hey, he Moved out this morning. He must have a new job -- he took his Copernicus costume."
Do you know where I could find him?
I think he's taking the next train to Capital City.
"The train, how like him... traditional, yet environmentally sound."
"Yes, and it's been the backbone of our country since Leland Stanford drove that golden spike at Promontory point."
"I see he touched you, too."
"Hey, thanks for your vote, man."
I didn't vote. Voting's for geeks.
"Well, you got that right. Thanks for your vote, girls."
We forgot.
"Well, don't sweat it. Just so long as a couple of people did... right, Milhouse?"
Uh oh.
Somebody must have voted.
"What about you, Bart? Didn't you vote?"
I demand a recount.
"One for Martin, two for Martin. Would you like another recount?"
"Well, I just want to make sure. One for Martin. Two for Martin."
"This way, Mister President!"
"Now boarding on track 5, The afternoon delight coming to Shelbyville, Parkville, andÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.."
"Mr. Bergstrom! Hey, Mr. Bergstrom!"
"Hey, Lisa."
"Hey,  indeed."
What? What is it?
"Oh, I mean, were you just going to leave, just like that?"
"Ah, I'm sorry, Lisa. You know, it's the life of the substitute teacher: he's a fraud. Today he might be wearing gym shorts, tomorrow he's speaking French, or, or, or pretending to know how to run a band saw, or God knows what."
You can't go! You're the best teacher I'll ever have.
"Ah, that's not true. Other teachers will come along who..."
"Oh, please."
"No, I can't lie to you, I am the best. But, you know, they need me over in the projects of Capital City."
But I need you too.
That's the problem with being middle class. Anybody who really cares will abandon you for those who need it more.
"I, I understand. Mr. Bergstrom, I'm going to miss you."
I'll tell you what...
"Whenever you feel like you're alone and there's nobody you can rely on, this is all you need to know."
"Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom."
All aboard!
"So, I guess this is it? It you don't mind I'll just run alongside the train as it speeds you from my life?"
"Goodbye, Lisa honey. It'll be okay. Just read the note."
Never thrown a party? What about that big bash we had with all the champagne and musicians and holy men and everything?
"Bart didn't get one vote?! Oh, this is the worst thing that ever happened to us. Alright, allright, spilled milk, spilled milk, spilled milk. What are you so mopey about?"
tell your father.
Mr. Bergstrom left today.
He's gone. Forever.
I didn't think you'd understand.
"Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand."
"I'm glad I'm not crying because I would hate for you to think that what I'm about to say is based on emotion. But you, sir, are a baboon!"
"Yes, you! Baboon, baboon, baboon, baboon!"
I don't think you realize what you're saying.
"Whoa, somebody was bound to say it one day. I just can't believe it was her."
"Did you hear that, Marge? She called me a baboon! The stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!"
"you are not allowed to have hurt feelings right now. There's a little girl upstairs who needs you. Her confidence in her father is shaken, and no little girl can be happy unless she has faith in her Daddy."
Go Away.
don't hold anything back. You can tell me. Are you crying because you called Daddy a baboon?
This isn't going well at all.
"Look, if you just want me to forgive you --"
"No, no, no. I just wish I knew what to say."
"Although, maybe this will help. Now you lost someone special and it hurts. I'm lucky because I never lost anyone special to me. Everyone special to me is under this roof."
That was our wedding.
"Children, it's time for you to go to bed."
"It's true. Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life, Lisa. There's probably some place where they all get together, and the food is real good, and guys like me are serving drinks. Oh well, maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your doll house for you. At least, I'm good at monkey work. You know... monkey. You know what I mean?"
I can hold these nails in place with my tail.
You're so silly.
Gimme a banana.
I don't have any banana.
"Come on, you're holding out on me."
"I'm sorry I called you a baboon, Dad."
Think nothing of it.
"Hey, what's the matter, son?"
"Ah, Dad, if just me, Milhouse and Lewis had voted..."
"Hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president?"
Would you have to do extra work?
"And is this Martin guy going to get to do anything neat, like throw out the first ball at the world series, huh?"
"Well, no."
"So, let the baby have his bottle, huh? That's my motto."
"Hey! Thanks, monkey-man."
Holy-moly... talk about parenting!
"Sleep well, Maggie. Ah, three for three."
"Homie, did you straighten everything out...?"
"Up... up... up... up... up... up. Don't say anything, Marge. Let's just go to bed. I'm on the biggest roll of my life."
Mmm... hors doovers.
Homer! You promised!
I promised I wouldn't eat? Never! You lie!
please. We've never thrown a party. Now we're gonna pay back all the friends who've invited us to their homes.
"But Mom, I want to hear the witty banter of sophisticated adults."
"Yeah, you can't have any fun in bed."
"Oh son, when you're older, you'll know better."
"Hmmm. Oh, baby! Mmmm. Yeah."
Oh! They're here! How does everything look?
How do I look?
Do we have enough glasses?
Do we have enough gag ice cubs?
Homer! Homer! Put a record on!
What are all our friends names again?
Children! Go!
"Hey, anybody mind if I serve as bartender? You know, I have a Ph.D in Mixology."
College boy.
"Hey, Homer! Care to try some of my Flanders Planters punch?"
Why not? I paid for it.
"Hey, Flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it?"
"Au contraire, Simpson! It has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and just little dab-a-roo of creme de cassis for flavor."
Really? Well I do have a warm sense of well-being and I seem to be ssslurring my shpeech... you're right! Give me another.
"Now,  go easy on the al-ky-hol. Remember last year at the Winfield's party when you threw up in the laundry hamper?"
"Hi! You're Homer's sister-in-law, right? I remember you, but I don't remember you being so beau --tiful."
Ow! Hey! Jeez!
Is that a new kind of Mace? It's really painful.
"Oh, Dr. Hibbert. Enjoying the party?"
"Uh, no, not really. Someone seems to have slipped one of those novelty ice cubes with a fake fly in my drink."
It was me! You fell for it!
"these novelty ice cubes are often made from highly toxic chemicals. Ironically, a real fly would have been much more sanitary."
Please Dad.
You should see the look on your face. It's priceless.
Bart! Come over here.
"You little monkey... you're a little monkey, aren't you?"
Yes sir.
do that thing you do that's so cute.
That thing you know how to do.
Go to bed.
"Hey, everybody! Look, I'm the funniest guy in the world!"
"Oh,  you're the king!"
"I've been wantin' to tell you off for years, but I've never had the nerve."
I don't know you. My wife and your wife are friends. We met just three hours ago.
You stink! You and your whole lousy operation stinks! I quit!
"Uh, gee  don't quit..."
All right then.
Could you... give me a handful of peanuts... Maude?
Oh sure.
Not those peanuts. The ones at the bottom.
"Hey, thanks for invitin' me. I had a wonderful time."
I must apologize for my husband.
"If you want him to live through the night, I suggest you roll him onto his side."
"Hmmm. thank you. I will, Dr. Hibbert. Thanks for coming."
"Remember, I said if."
I have never been so embarrassed in my life.
Why? What'd you do?
Come here!
Where-where are we going?
"I want to make sure the kids don't hear. When I was young, I always hated knowing my parents were fighting."
They're fighting in the car again.
That music always sends a chill down my spine.
do you remember the way you acted at the party last night?
The way I acted?
So I said: I must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini.
Good lord! There's a fly in my drink!
I put it there.
You did?
I slipped it into your glass as a gag.
Pure hilarity!
Pure Homer!
I pronounce it to be the most whimsical jape of the season!
"I like to think that I'm a patient, tolerant woman, and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you. But last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it!"
"I'm sorry, honey. Can't we just forget it and go to church."
I'm going to church alone today. You're going to stay here and explain to Bart why you scarred him for life.
"No, I didn't... I... Oh, you mean inside, don't you?"
About last night... you might have noticed Daddy acting a little strange and you probably don't understand why.
I understand why. You were wasted.
I admit it. I didn't know when to say when. I'm sorry it happened and I just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect for me.
"Dad, I have as much respect for you as I ever did or ever will."
"Now before I give you all a sneak preview of next week's sermon, I have some announcements to make. We have some new pamphlets available in our church newsrack including ""Bible Bafflers"", ""Satan's Boners,"" ""Good Grief! More Satan's Boners"" and, for the teens, ""It's Not Cool To Fry In Hell."""
I'm sorry. The Lord and I can't compete with the squeaking of Homer Simpson's shoes. Why don't we just put everything on hold until he takes a seat?
"Sorry, Reverend."
"Sit down, Homer."
Mrs. Lovejoy and myself will be holding our third annual marriage retreat next weekend at Catfish Lake. It's psychological counseling for couples whose marriages are hanging by a thread...
... or those just in need of a tune-up.
"Now if you wish to participate, please sign up on your way out after the service is over."
Will the Simpsons be attending our little retreat?
"Oh, well, it's very tempting. Really a wonderful idea."
Marge! What are you doing? Are you insane?!
We'll be there!
"Marriage encounter weekend, here I come!"
Now you wanna go?
They're holding it at Catfish Lake. They couldn't call it Catfish Lake if it didn't have a catfish in it.
We're going to this retreat to give our marriage a tune-up and that's all. No fishing.
"Oh, that must be the babysitter."
Hello. I'm Mrs. Simpson.
Simpson... Simpson...
"Come back for more, eh?"
Oh my. Where are we supposed to get a sitter on such short notice?
"Oh dear. If we can't find a babysitter, we can't go. What a kick in the teeth."
What do you need a babysitter for? I'm almost ten and a half.
Mom! You wouldn't dare.
"Don't take that tone with me, young lady, or I'll give you a taste of the back of me hand."
"No, you don't!"
Huh... who?... what?
could you do something?
I can dress myself.
"Well, I was wondering. Do you think you could babysit the kids this weekend? I wouldn't ask, except I'm desperate."
"Oh sure. Last resort... Old  the feeb. The guy who can't be counted on for nothing, no how, dagnabit. Everyone's agin me. I'll do it."
just puttin' a few last things in the trunk.
"Now, if Maggie runs a fever, you call this number. If she sticks her finger in an electrical socket, call this number. And if she drinks pine cleanser, call this..."
Just give me the list. I can read.
"All right. All right. Goodbye, children. And behave yourselves."
Call this number if Grampa falls in the bathtub.
I heard that.
"Mom was in such a hurry, she forgot to give you this. It's a list of the things Lisa and I can and can't do."
Uh huh .. Uh-huh... You're allowed smoke cigars?
"Hmmm, bait."
"Whoa, better get some gas."
Fill 'er up. I guess I'll go and stretch my legs.
Where ya headed?
Catfish Lake.
"Oh, after General Sherman, are ya?"
"Wait, wait a minute... wait a minute. Who's General Sherman?"
He's only the biggest catfish in these parts...
Oh yeah.
... they say he weighs upwards of five hundred pounds.
"Whoa, who says that?"
They do.
"Now, that there's the only known picture of the General. Can't see what he is, exactly. He's freakishly big, though."
Hmmmm. Gentlemen: I am going to catch General Sherman!
"After the supermarket, we'll go to the video store, grab a Krusty Burger and head for the arcade."
Grampa's a kindly old man who trusts us. Are you sure it's right to take advantage of him?
"Lis, in these crazy, topsy-turvy times, who's to say what's right or wrong? But right now my gut's telling me... Bleed Gramps dry."
"Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson. Welcome!"
"Hello, Reverend. We're glad we could come. Oh, hello Helen."
Hel-lo Marge!
"Why, Homer Simpson! Here to give your marriage a little spit shine?"
"None of your business, Flanders."
Uh say... uh... Reverend... are we gonna get a chance to do any fishing?
"Oh, I'm afraid not. A marriage can't be reconciled in a few hours, Homer. It takes a whole weekend to do that."
We must bait our hooks with honesty. That way a happy marriage won't be the one that got away.
I see. I also understand bowling expressions.
"Ah, three couples... our best turnout yet. Why don't we go around the room and everyone can introduce themselves and tell us a little bit about why they're here. John... Gloria?"
"My name's Gloria. I'm here because Johnny boy hasn't been able to cut it, manwise, for some time. Not that I'd want his odor of gin and sour defeat pressed against me."
"That's enough, Gloria!"
"Thank you, Gloria. John, why don't you tell us a little about why you're here?"
"She never cooks, she keeps a filthy house and she talks profanely. She's the Queen of the Harpies."
"No, I'm not!"
Queen of the Harpies!
"Here's your crown, your Majesty."
"Get away from me, swine."
"You've come to the right place. First, I want you to look into each other's eyes."
Your eyes? I'd forgotten how beautiful they are.
Let's never fight again.
We were fools to argue.
Let's not talk about that.
Let's not talk at all.
"Remember my saving your lives and bringing you happiness when we pass the collection plate next week. All right. Ned, Maude, what brings you here?"
"Go on, Neddie."
"Sometimes Maude, God bless her, she underlines passages in my Bible because she can't find hers."
Lucky you don't keep guns in the house.
why are you here?
"Ohhh, because I got drunk and looked down her dress."
"No, no, Homer. Marge is going to tell us all your faults. Why don't you tell us about hers?"
She's perfect.
"Come on, Homer. What are her faults?"
"Well, sometimes that can be annoying."
"Oh, Homer."
"Now, Marge. Don't interrupt. You'll get your turn."
I'm done.
Okay. Marge?
"Well, it's not that I don't love the guy. I'm always sticking up for him. It's just that he's so self-centered."
"Now, Homer."
"He forgets birthdays, anniversaries, holidays -- both religious and secular -- he chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy bar with bums and lowlifes..."
It's true. It's all true.
don't interrupt.
"He blows his nose on the towels, and puts them back in the middle..."
I only did that a couple of times.
Half a gallon of chocolate.
Half a gallon of chocolate brownie fudge.
"Half a gallon of chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate chip."
Did your Mom really write that shopping list?
what a question?
"What's next, Lis?"
Sprinkles and syrup.
"Hey, Grampa. Aisle six and step on it."
"Well, all right, but put out that cigar."
"... He drinks out of the carton. He never changes the baby. When he goes to sleep, he makes chewing noises and when he wakes up he makes honking noises. Oh... oh... and he scratches himself with his keys. I guess that's it. Oh no. Wait. He kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are too long and yellow. That's all I can think of right now. I guess you're all tired and I want to thank you for letting me get some things off my chest."
"Well, we've missed the luau. What say we call it a night?"
"I don't want to hear it, McBain. That cannon of yours is against regulations. In this department we go by the book."
"You know, kids, it's gettin' pretty late."
"Yeah, you should go to bed, Grampa. We've had a big day."
It's no use kidding myself. I'm having an ethical crisis.
"Out at five, catch General Sherman at five-thirty, clean him at six, eat him at six-thirty, back in bed by seven with no incriminating evidence. . The perfect crime."
"you're sneaking out to go fishing? I can't believe your selfishness. You can go fishing anytime, but we're here trying to save our marriage. You're thinking about fishing, even when I'm talking... right now. Right?"
Would this be a good time to be honest?
"You're right, I am. Help me, Marge. What do I do to be a good guy?"
Get back in bed.
All right. But I can't sleep. Can I take a walk?
Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband.
"Hey, kid! You forgot your... WHOA!"
"Go ahead, General Sherman! Waste your strength, you big ugly catfish. I gotta skillet and a stick of butter with your name on it."
Yes. Ten please.
Hey  top me off.
Are you sure your ma lets you kids drink coffee?
"For the last time, yes!"
Good! Give up!
"Hey, Milhouse. Big blowout at Casa de Simpson. The only adult is frail and old."
"Bart's joint. Uh, twoish. Be there or be square."
"Tell my friends? All right, but I've got some pretty funky friends."
All right! I get out at noon and I'm already invited to a party.
"Now, this is a trust exercise. You fall backwards and rely on your spouse to catch you."
Do I have to do this?
"No. Even if your husband were here, I wouldn't recommend it.  as a trained marriage counselor, this is the first instance where I've ever told one partner that they were 100 percent right. It's all his fault, and I'm willing to put that in a certificate you can frame."
Over there / Send the word / Send the word / Over there.
That the Yanks are comin'...
"Okay, fish, you're probably wondering why I'm still here. Catching you will make me the most famous fisherman there is, right up there with... that... the a... bald guy on that cable fishing show."
Whoa! Holy mackerel!
"good to see you, pal. What's happening, man?"
"Cherry party, Bart. Any chicks over eight?"
"Not yet, but the afternoon is young."
what's wrong?
Isn't it obvious? We've degraded ourselves and set back the children's rights movement for decades to come.
"You're great at a party, Lisa. Really great."
"Hey you, no, shut that door! Stop it! Put that away! No, stop, oh!"
Haw haw haw!
"You young hellion, do you want me to take off my belt?"
All right. I'll show you.
Haw! Haw! Haw!
Doggone it!
"I love you, but I must kill you."
"Yeah, take care, man. Hey, thanks for coming. Hey, nice tie, Nelson.."
"Ah, thanks, it's your dad's."
"I tried to be a good baby-sitter, but I failed! I'm a feeb... a useless old... worn-out..."
I have this strong unpleasant feeling I've never had before.
"It's called remorse, you vile burlesque of irrepressible youth."
"Well, how do you make this feeling go away?"
You grab a bucket and a brush and clean harder and faster than you ever have before.
I AM THE CHAMPIONS / I AM THE CHAMPIONS / NO TIME FOR LOSERS / CAUSE I AM THE CHAMPIONS / OF THE WORLLLLD!
"Uh, oh."
"Hi, honey. Uh, oh. How's the marriage retreat going?"
"We came to this retreat because I thought our marriage was in trouble, but I never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble.  how can you expect me to believe...."
you don't know what this fish means. This fish represents a better life for both of us. This fish makes me a champion and a hero.
To who?
To those weirdos in the worm store.
All this fish represents is just how selfish you are.
"Well, if that's the way you feel... I'll throw it back."
"Oh yeah, sure."
"Wow, I did it! I gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. I fought it for six hours. She says one word and I toss it back. And you're telling me our marriage is in trouble? Come here, baby."
"Ohhh, Homer."
We're back!
How's your marriage?
Same as usual. Perfectomundo.
"Oh my, the house looks wonderful.  what's your secret?"
"Pretending to cry. That's right, you heard me. Pretending to cry. I can turn it on and off like a fawcet. Boo-hoo, Oh, I'm crying, I'm so sad."
"Way to go, Grampa."
I'll never trust another old person.
I fooled you. So long suckers. Hee hee hee.
"Yup. General Sherman. They say he's 500 pounds of bottom-dwelling fury, don't you know? No one knows how old he is, but if you ask me, and most people do, he's a hundred years if he's a day."
"And uh, no one's ever caught him?"
"Well, one fella came close. Went by the name of Homer. Seven feet tall he was, with arms like tree trunks. And his eyes were like steel, cold and hard. Had a shock of hair, red, like the fires of hell."
"Hurry, Mom! If we don't get to the convention soon, all the good comics will be gone."
Wow! Number nine! That's before Fallout Boy became his ward.
What do you care about good comics? All you ever buy is Casper the Wimpy Ghost.
"I think it's sad that you equate friendliness from wimpiness, and I hope it will keep you from ever achieving true popularity."
"Well, you know what I think? I think Casper's the ghost of Richie Rich."
"Hey, they do look alike!"
I wonder how Richie died?
"Perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money is, and took his own life."
"Kids, could you lighten up a little?"
"Now, Radioactive Man: He rules! Never punches a bad guy without saying something cool."
He's no wittier than the next superhero.
"Oh, yeah? Look. He knocks a guy into the sun and says, ""Hot enough for ya?"""
I stand corrected.
We're here!
Too bad we didn't come dressed as popular cartoon characters.
This looks like a discount for...
Who are you supposed to be?
I'm Bartman!
Never heard of him. Full price.
Lousy rip off...
"Is uh, this on?... Ahem, young people of Springfield: As your Mayor, I'd like to welcome you to our annual funny book convention, and thank you for pumping almost three hundred dollars into the local economy."
Your youthful high spirits have imparted a glow to this old war-horse. You might say I feel like Radiation Man!
"That's Radioactive Man, jerk!"
"I stand corrected... Well, have fun and be sure to clear out by six for the Shriners. Get that punk's name. No one makes a fool out of Diamond Joe Quimby."
"Excuse me, sir. Has anyone turned in a left Vulcan ear?"
"Let's see, we've got a utility belt, a couple of tricorders, a light saber... Sorry, kid."
"Hey, Bart-dude!"
"Hey, Otto-man! Oooh, what's that?"
"My very own idea for a comic book, little man. It's about a dude who drives a school bus by day, but by night, fights vampires in a post-apocalyptic warzone!"
"C'mon, Bart. We're going to see Buddy Hodges."
The guy who played Fallout Boy on TV?
"Wow, I guess he wasn't killed in Vietnam."
Aaahh... These Laramie cigarettes give me the steady nerves I need to combat evil.
"Gee whillikers, Radioactive Man. Wisht I was old enough to smoke Laramies."
"Sorry, Fallout Boy, not until you're sixteen."
Look out!
Will Radioactive Man act in time to save the earth?
"Well, wasn't that great?... Y'know, kids, I'm sure we'd all like to remember actor Dirk Richter for his portrayal of Radioactive Man, and not the sordid details of his final years, so let's keep the questions tasteful, okay? Now how about a big welcome for Buddy ""Fallout Boy"" Hodges!"
Any questions?
"When Radioactive Man got injected with shrinking serum in issue two-thirty-four, how come his costume shrinks, too?"
"I am sure I don't know. But I did just finish playing Rum Tum Tugger in the second national touring company of ""Cats"" -- anybody see it?"
"Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Over here, Fallout Boy! Oh, oh, me... me... me... me, me."
"Yes, you, the masked boy."
Do you think the ghost of Dirk Richter haunts the bordello where his bullet-riddled body was found?
Dirk Richter was a beautiful man. Can't you little vultures leave him alone?
"Hey, Radioactive Man number seventy-two! It's the imaginary tale where Radioactive Man marries Larva Girl."
Tell you what. I'll show you something very special if you promise to put your grubby little hands behind your back and keep 'em there.
Wow. Radioactive Man Number One.
None other.
I bet it's worth a million bucks!
"It is, my lad. But I'll let you have it for a hundred because you remind me of me."
All I got is thirty.
Then you cannot have it.
"But I must. Until this moment, I never knew why God put me on this earth, but now I know... to buy that comic book."
"Your emotion is out of place here, son."
"So, did you kids have fun?"
"Yeah, Mom! Guess what? For a dollar a man sold me thirty-five Caspers and a dozen Lois Lanes."
I never knew what Superman saw in her. Give me Wonder Woman! And that golden lariat. She can tie me up any time.
"I was just kidding, Marge. Hey, what does everyone say to dinner at Krusty Burger? My treat!"
"All right, Homer. Whoa, you really are a sport, Dad, taking us out to a fine restaurant like Krusty Burger!"
"All right, what are you getting at?"
I need a hundred dollars for a comic book.
"A hundred bucks?! For a comic book? Who drew it, Micha-ma-langelo?"
"Oh please, Dad. I want this more than anything in the world."
"Well, t.s."
"No! Now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, I give in, so I'm not mad at you for trying. It shows you've been paying attention. But we all know I'm not gonna give you a hundred dollars. Now are you gonna stop bugging me?"
Are you?
"Hee hee, I win! In your face! Yeah! How do you like them apples? Woo hoo hoo!"
"Don't gloat, Homer. You know,  when I was your age, the one thing I wanted more than anything in the world was a Child-sized Electric Lightbulb Oven. My parents wouldn't give me the money, so I went to my sisters, Patty and Selma..."
We'll give you half our allowance.
Uh-huh. But you have to be our slave.
This gives us a lot more free time.
Uh-huh. Let's take up smoking.
"For months, I worked and worked, while my sisters smoked and smoked..."
"Venus... Oh, Venus..."
We want those dress-shields hand-washed and drip-dried.
Haw haw!
Here we are.
"But the big day finally came. And because I'd worked for it, all those lightbulb-warmed treats always tasted extra-good."
So maybe a part-time job is the answer.
"Aw, Mom, I couldn't ask you to do that. You're already taking care of Maggie, and Lisa is such a handful --"
"She means you should get a job, stupid."
"Get a job! Were they serious? I didn't realize it at the time, but a little piece of my childhood had slipped away... forever."
Bart! What are you staring at?
Uh... nothing.
"He didn't say it, and neither did I, but at that moment my dad and I were closer than we ever..."
Bart! Stop it!
I NEED SOME MONEY / A LOT OF MONEY... AHH
Empty bottles... empty bottles...
"Hm... well, it's practically empty."
"Here you go, Apu."
"Ooh, very good. Would you like the deposit defrayed from the cost of a Jumbo Cherry Squishie?"
"No, not today. I need the dime."
"Oh, it is good to see you are learning a trade."
"Americanize this, my good man."
Okey dokey.
All those coins were only worth three lousy cents?
Let the good times roll.
"Oh, this is so humiliating... I feel like such a geek."
"How's it going, Bart?"
"Terrible. Cars slow down to laugh at me, but no one's buying."
Maybe you need to play on their sympathies more. Lets see...
"Ah ha, now you look pathetic."
Lemonade sucks. I need a new product. Let's see... ... Ah!
"Form a line, no crowding. Cheap beer and a sympathetic ear... Step right up."
"Ah, Bart could you give me one on credit? I'm a little short this week."
Beat it.
"Say, uh, you got a liquor license there, young fella?"
"Ugh, my dog ate it."
Gotta have a license to sell beer.
Say... writing all those tickets must make you guys thirsty. How about a couple on the house?
"We-ell, seeing as how it's a first offense..."
I guess we can overlook this.
"So long, officers. Uh-oh."
"Hey, what's all the --"
My beer... my beer... my beautiful beer.
The poor boy is so desperate. He wants to earn money to buy a comic book.
"A comic book! Oh, my, boys never change. Which one is it, ""Nazi Smasher""?"
I don't think so.
"Send him over to my house, I got a few chores he could do. He knows how to mix whitewash, don't he?"
Mrs. Glick?
"Eh, you must be Burt Simpson! Well, you look like you've got a strong young back!"
"Would you like something to eat? I've got dried apricots... almond paste, sauerkraut candy."
"No, thanks. Who's that?"
"Oh, that's my brother, Asa. He was killed in the Great War. Held a grenade too long."
"This one's for you Kaiser Bill. Special delivery from Uncle Sam and all the boys in D Company: Yeah! Johnny, Harrison, Brooklyn Bob and Reggie. Yeah, even Reggie. He ain't so stuck-up once you get to know..."
"Here, have some ribbon candy. Boys love candy."
"No, thanks."
Boys love candy.
"Oh, yes, ma'am!"
"Ugh, I think I'd rather just get to work, Ma'am."
"We'll start with a little light yard work. And when you're done, you can have a nice barley pop."
I want you to clear out all the weeds. You do know which ones are weeds?
All of 'em?
Good boy.
Now be careful with these. I'll be inside watching my stories.
Ow!. . .Ow!
"Jack, please. I'm married."
That must be what's turning me on.
Oh... Stop it... some more.
"Filthy, but genuinely arousing."
"Merciful heavens, you're bleeding! I'll get the iodine."
"Now, don't fidget."
"Listen, lady, you don't have to -- YAAAUUUUGGGHHH!"
They've never improved on iodine.
"Hi, Mom."
Did you make any money?
"Not yet, but at least I'm in a lot of pain."
"Well, I think what you're doing for Mrs. Glick is very nice. The poor old thing doesn't have anybody."
There's a reason.
"The sludge certainly collects around those downspouts, don't it?"
"I'll sludge you, you old bat."
"Today, we wash Beulah. Do you know what that is?"
"Some old lady thing, nobody's heard about for fifty years?"
"No, it was my wedding dress, but then I dyed it black and it became my mourning dress."
"Great story, lady."
Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms.
"No! No, not the iodine! Burn the germs off with a torch, amputate my arm, but not the -- YAAAUUUGGGHHH!"
"Well, it's payday. I'll wager you've been looking forward to this."
Two quarters.
Two quarters?
"You deserve every penny. You know, I've told a lot of my girlfriends about you and they have chores too."
Two quarters!
you didn't say thank you.
"Listen lady, I can leave without screaming, and I can leave without saying a bad word, but there's no way that I am saying thank you."
"You're welcome. All right then, off you go, to spend it on penny whistles and moon pies."
"Moon pies, my butt... Somebody oughta moon pie her..."
"What's the problem, boy?"
"I've been bustin' my hump all week for that withered old clam, and all I got was fifty cents."
"Hey, when I was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money."
"Dad, I've done everything I could and I've only got thirty-five bucks. Ugh.. I am through with working. Working is for chumps."
"Son, I'm proud of you. I was twice your age before I figured that out."
Can you let me have it for forty dollars?
Forty bucks? Forget it! You made me get off my stool for that?
"It's all I've got. I sold seeds. I visited my aunt in the nursing home. I fished a dime out of the sewer, for God's sake!"
No way. What do you want?
Can I have it for thirty-five?
"No!... No!... Freakin' kids. I do not need this, I've got a Masters degree in folklore and mythology."
"Excuse me, do you have the Carl Yastrzemski baseball card from 1973, when he had big sideburns?"
"Show me the thirty bucks, because if you ain't got it, I ain't gettin' off the stool."
"Wait a minute, Martin. If you, Milhouse and I went in together, we could buy a copy of ""Radioactive Man No. 1"" right now!"
"Here you go. ""Muttonchop Yaz."""
I don't want it.
Freakin' kids!
"Look, pal. We've got a hundred bucks and we'd like to buy ""Radioactive Man No. 1"". So why don't you just waddle over there and get it."
"Wow! Breathe it in, boys!"
This is the stuff dreams are made of.
It smells like my grandpa.
"Uh-oh, looks like rain. We better get this baby home."
Looks like you bought more than you bargained for.
My pants... caught on barbed wire... Good Lord Choke... an A-bomb!
"I'm becoming radioactive. From this day forward, I shall call myself Radioactive Man."
So that's how it happened!
I would've thought being hit by an atomic bomb would have killed him.
Now you know better.
"Turn the page, Bart."
"Listen, you guys are welcome to come over and read it any time you like."
Why can't we keep it at my house?
Your house? That's crazy talk!
"Well, the comic's ours as much as it is yours."
"How about this, guys. Bart can have it Mondays and Thursdays. Milhouse will get it Tuesdays and Fridays. And yours truly will take it Wednesdays and Saturdays."
Wait a minute. What about Sunday?
Yeah. What about Sunday?
"Well, Sunday possession will be determined by a random number generator. I will take the digits one through three. Milhouse will have four through six. And Bart will have seven through nine."
Wait a minute. What about zero?
Yeah! What about zero?
"Well, in the unlikely event of a zero, possession will be determined by ""Rock, Scissor, Paper"" competition. Best three out of five, how's that?"
"Excellent! Well, today being Saturday, Gentlemen, I guess I'll be taking my comic and..."
"Uh, uh, uh, ah nice try, Martin. It almost worked. But tonight, this comic book stays right here."
"If the comic book stays right here, then so do I."
Me too!
"Fine. We're all going to stay here with the comic book. It'll be like a sleep-over. Yeah, a sleep-over. That's what pals do, right? Real friendly-like."
I want to read it again.
"Nice try, mister."
"the acids in your hands could damage the newsprint. We want to keep this comic forever, so the last one alive will have the honor of being buried with it."
"What do you mean, the last one alive?"
I meant years from now.
"Yeah, sure you did."
don't push him!
"I knew it. You're both against me! Well, nobody makes a sap out of Bartholemew J. Simpson."
I thought you boys might like some milk and microwave s'mores.
"Thank you, Mrs. Simpson."
"Sweet dreams, boys."
One more step and you're a dead man.
"I have to go to the bathroom, Bart."
"Yeah, right, so do I, but you don't see me gettin' up."
"Hey, what's going on?"
Our dear friend Martin was trying to steal the comic book.
Let's tie him up!
is this how you treat all your guests?
"Hmp, impressive."
"Quiet, Piggy, or we'll stick an apple in your mouth. We can't take any chances. We'll have to take turns watching him."
Okay. I'll go first.
"Oh, so that's your little game. Let old Bart get nice and drowsy, then, when his back is turned... wham!"
"Well, it is not going to happen, see?"
"You're going crazy, Bart. I'm telling your mom!"
"Hey Martin, tell him what we do with squealers."
I don't know. Is it worse than what you do with people that have to go to the bathroom?
You can't stop me.
The hell I can't!
it's really coming down. Could you check on the boys?
They're fine.
the comic!
Don't let go of me Bart!
it's not that far to the ground. And the rain has probably softened it up a bit.
"No, Bart! No!"
"You know, if you guys hadn't tied me up, I could be saving the comic as we speak."
Shut up! Shut up!
"Help me, Bart! I didn't even want the comic. I wanted Carl Yastrzemski with the big side-burns."
"Boys, you better come in the house. You don't want to get the sniffles."
"Aw, Mom."
Now come on... You can play your little tie-up game inside. I've got some cocoa on the stove. Who wants imitation marshmallows?
"I'd raise my hand, Mrs.  if I could."
"It's no use, fellows. Another comic book has returned to the earth from whence it came."
We worked so hard and now it's all gone... We ended up with nothing because the three of us can't share.
What's your point?
Nothing. It just kind of ticks me off.
"Well, the world is safe again... but for how long?"
"Ah, Chief Wiggum, Archbishop McGee, distinguished guests. I am pleased to dedicate this emergency warning system. In the uh, off chance of a nuclear disaster, this sign will tell you, the good citizens of Springfield, what to do."
"Joke's on them. If the core explodes, there won't be any power to light that sign."
"And now, I would like to present the man who made this sign possible, by dropping the last of his obstructionist legal challenges... Montgomery Burns."
Mr. Burns is never late. Something must be terribly wrong.
"Well, there better be. Nobody leaves Diamond Joe Quimby holding the bag!"
Must... turn... over. Got to... greet... dignitaries!
"Oh, no, Mr. Burns! We've got to get a doctor!"
"Absolutely not! No quack sawbones is going to apply his leeches to me! As long as there's an ounce of strength left in me, I..."
Mmmm. Mr. Burns is suffering from what we medical men call hypohemia. In layman's terms it's quite simply a lack of blood.
"Damn it, doctor, I'm no idiot! I know what hypohemia is. What I want to know is what can we do about it?"
"Well, at this point, our only hope is a transfusion."
How long does it take to sterilize a needle?
A few seconds.
"Well, skip it."
Just leave me enough to get home.
I'm afraid it's not that simple. His blood type is Double-O-Negative. It's quite rare.
But I'm B positive. Damn this common gutter blood in my veins!
"Smithers, don't feel so bad. After all, that kidney you donated to me really hit the spot."
How many hairs on my head? Without looking!
Go ahead.
"Attention all employees. Our boss and inspiration, Mr. Burns... is at death ... death's door. If you have type Double-O-Negative blood, I implore you to report to the Bloodmobile outside. That is all."
"I'd give him my blood, except for one thing."
What's that?
I don't wanna.
"I can't believe you guys. There's a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help. And you don't wanna cash in? That's why you losers are stuck in this crummy, dead end job."
"You know,  I am your supervisor."
"Sorry, sir."
"Maggie, look. What's that?"
Lee-mur. Lee-mur.
Zee-boo. Zee-boo.
"What are you doing, honey?"
I'm trying to teach Maggie that nature doesn't end with the barnyard. I want her to have all the advantages that I didn't have.
we did the best we could... What's a zebu?
"It's like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap. Hump and dew-lap. Hump and dew-lap."
Marge! Marge! What's my blood type?
"Aw, nuts! Extremely rare blood and I don't have it."
"You know his blood type, how romantic."
A mother knows everything about her family.
"Oh, yeah? What's my shoe size?"
Four B.
How many teeth do I have?
"Sixteen permanent, eight baby."
"I don't want you wearing rings, it looks cheap, but three."
Butterscotch and imitation butterscotch.
Glow in the dark monster make-up.
"Oh, Homie, you have lots of hair... Why did you want to know your blood type?"
"Aw, old man Burns is gonna kick off if he doesn't get some Double-O-Negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it."
Bart does.
"Woo! Yes! All right! Woo! Congratulations, boy! You've got a date with a needle!"
"Hey, wait a minute. I don't have to give blood. I have rights, you know."
"Yeah, you have the right to remain silent."
you have to help someone in need. It's the only decent thing to do.
"it's not like I'm asking you to give blood for free. That would be crazy! You're a little young to understand this, but when you save a rich man's life, he showers you with riches. Don't you know the story of Hercules and the Lion?"
Is it a Bible story?
"Yeah, probably. Anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. And all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. So they got Hercules, and Hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. Anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big thing of riches."
How did a lion get rich?
It was the olden days!
"Hey, let's go! Emergency! Life-or-death here!"
"Just a sec, man!"
"Whoa, Otto-man! You work here?"
"Oh yeah! During the day, all my friends are in school, so I got a job as a Certified Bloodletting Tech Dude."
Now let's get the show on the road.
Okay. Let me wash up.
brave young Bart. I don't know which one to hug first.
Eh.... the boy.
We're ready with the transfusion.
"Smithers, I'm not going to make it. I want to dictate... my epitaph."
Charles... Montgomery... Burns.
"Um, hmm."
American Patriot
... American Patriot.
Master Of The Atom.
Scourge Of The Despot.
"""O Tyrant Hear His Mighty Name And QUAKE!!"" Smithers, I'm back!"
"Oh, top o' the mornin' to ye! Why, look who's here! It's good old... you!"
"Hi, Mr. Burns."
"Oh, hey, there, Mr... Brown Shoes! How about that local sports team? Hm?"
Mr. Burns... he's okay! Jackpot!
"Aye, caramba!"
"Heh-heh-heh! Well, that's game! Hasta manana, Osvaldo!"
"Smithers, I'm back in the pink! Full of pith and vinegar!"
"Just remarkable, sir."
"You know, it's funny, Smithers. I tried every tincture and poultice and tonic and patent medicine there is. And all I really needed was the blood of a young boy. By the way, what was the lad's name?"
"Uh, Bart  sir."
He's the son of Homer Simpson. One of your stiffs in Sector 7-G.
"Well, the Simpsons will be getting a very nice surprise in the mail. Very nice, indeed."
"Bill... Bill... Summons... Bill... Wait a minute. From C.M. Burns? Is this it? Yes, this is it! Woo-hoo! Woo!"
Marge! Lisa! Maggie! Let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors can see!
"dim the lights! No, turn on more lights! But do something!"
"Yes, Dad."
"It's a little thin, but that's okay, could be a check."
The meaning of what?
"""Better half,"" Marge. ""Better half."""
"All right, there's no check, just a card. But don't panic. I'm sure it tells us what we're getting and where we can pick it up. ""Dear Bart... Thank you kindly for the blood. Yours truly, Montgomery Burns."" It's just a card!"
"This is some way to show your gratitude. No gold. No diamonds. No rubies. Not even a lousy card. Wait a minute, there was a card. That's what got me so mad in the first place."
you don't do things like that to be rewarded. You do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand.
"you're my wife and I love you very much. But you're living in a world of make-believe. With flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats..."
"Yeah, Mom. We got hosed!"
We got exactly what we wanted out of this: We gave an old man a second chance.
"I promised my boy one simple thing: Lots of riches. And that man broke my promise. Well, I've had it!  take a letter."
"""Dear Mr. Burns. I'm so glaaad you enjoyed my son's blood. And your caard was just great. In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic. You stink!"" Could you read that last part back to me?"
You stink.
"Good. ""You are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like..."""
An elephant's butt?
An elephant's butt.
But he's your boss. Do you have to mail it right this minute?
"You're still angry, Homer. Why don't you sleep on it?"
"Forget it, Marge!"
"Please, Homie? For me?"
"Oh, all right. You always do that hand thing! And it usually works."
Cheap son-of-a...
Homer... Breakfast is ready.
"Oh,  you saved me from making a big mistake. Y'know, I finally understand the meaning of mmphm hnmph."
Oh... thank you.
Where's the letter?
Where is it?
I don't think it's in the cornstarch canister.
"Well, it's somewhere! It didn't just get up and walk away!"
have you seen the letter?
"All right, think very carefully. Where did you see it last?"
The last place I saw it...
Uh huh.
...was in my hand...
...as I was shoving it into the mailbox.
Why did you do that?
"Dad, there were things in the letter that had to be said. And I know you. You're an emotional guy. Just because you were mad last night, is no guarantee you'd be mad in the morning. So I..."
I'll show you mad in the morning.
you encouraged him. You should be strangling yourself.
"She's right. Okay, think, Homer. Don't panic. They don't pick up the mail till noon. There's still time!"
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
"Give it up, Homer. It's locked up tight."
"Locked, eh? Well, I just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old Mr. Lock. Step aside, boy."
"Hey, I'm with you, Homer. Fight the power!"
"Why the hose, Homer?"
"What does it look like? I'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it."
"Yeah, but don't other people have mail in there?"
"So a few people won't get a few letters. Boo-hoo. You know the kinda letters people write: ""Dear Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of... How is So-and-So? Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Yours truly, Some Bozo."" Big loss."
Now  you keep an eye out for the mailman. Just give me some kind of signal.
"Dad, the mailman is here."
That's a good one. We'll use that.
"No, I mean the mailman's here."
Dear God! Are you planning to water the mail?
"Uh, uh I-I guess it wouldn't do any good to run, 'cause you're our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh?"
That's right.
"Well, I'm still gonna run!"
I want the whole world to hear the story of my harrowing struggle with hypohemia.
"Well, sir, Mr. Roman is one of the finest ghostwriters in the business."
"He's written ""Like Hell I Can't!""... ""Up From The Muck""... and ""The Unsinkable Sadruddin Mahbaradad!"""
"All right, all right. First question? Have you slept with anyone famous?"
"Well, Countess Van Zeplin and I... What in blaze... Now you listen to me, you bargain basement Baudelaire. I'm not some dizzy starlet who can't string two words together. I can write this thing myself. You're fired."
"Okay, Mr. Burns. What's your first name?"
I don't know.
"Great plan, Bart."
"Ooh, look, Maggie, what is that? Do-dec-ah-edron. Dodecahedron."
"I don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange and your father is trying to worry."
"""Chapter the Fifth... A Trip to the Infirmary, With Most Unexpected Results."""
Twenty eight minutes till Burns comes. Time for operation Mail Take.
Can I help you?
"They always told me I was gonna destroy the family, but I never believed it."
"Oh, don't be frightened of this. It's nothing but a letter opener. Who are you?"
Homer Simpson.
"Yeah, well I'll be on my --"
"Hello, there's more. ""In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic..."""
"""...you stink, you are a senile, buck-toothed..."" ""...old mummy... with bony girl arms and you smell like an elephant's butt!"""
"Hey, c'mon, Joey! Do you have to twist my arm?"
I don't tell you how to do your job. Okay?
"I could crush him like an ant, but it would be too easy. No, revenge is a dish best served cold. I'll bide my time until... Oh, what the hell. I'll just crush him like an ant."
"""Senile,"" eh? ""Buck-toothed,"" am I? ""Bony arms,"" are they? ""Liver spots,"" did I? ""Chinless,"" will you?"
"His pink slip awaits your signature, sir."
"Now, that's odd. I've just robbed a man of his livelihood, and yet I feel strangely empty. Tell you what, Smithers. Have him beaten to a pulp."
"But, sir --"
But what?
"Nothing, sir."
"Oh, I've never seen Mr. Burns this mad and he's always kinda mad."
Me and my big... letter writing pen!
"Honey, what's done is done. No matter what happens, we'll pull through. We always do."
"Okay, here's the plan. You can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. And I'll... die in a gutter. It's practical and within our means."
"That's okay, Bart. Nobody really believed it. We were just trying to scare you."
You know Homer Simpson?
"Yeah, nice guy. Play poker with him once in a while."
"Hmmm huh. We uh, need him beaten up."
You got it.
What is it?
"Ah, nothing."
"Beat, but don't kick."
Hold the kicks. Got it.
"Uh, um, umm..."
"Hey, what did Homie do anyway?"
He saved Mr. Burns' life!
"In closing, gentle reader, I'd like to thank you. What's that you say? Me thanking you? No, it's not a misprint. For you see, I enjoyed writing this book as much as you enjoyed reading it. The end."
"Ah Smithers, how'd the beating go?"
"Sir, uh... there was no beating."
What? Well that's a hell of a thing! Why?
Because... I... I called it off.
"I'm sorry, sir. But I just couldn't hurt Homer Simpson. He saved your life."
I see.
"I know you're mad at me, but I think it's only fair to warn you, I'm going to stand outside the gate until you forgive me."
"No need, Smithers. As usual, you've been the sober ""ying"" to my raging ""yang."" Put 'er there, old pal."
"Sir, while I wish this handshake would never end, I'm, I'm afraid we still have the Simpson matter to attend to."
"We do indeed, old friend. We do indeed."
Moe's Tavern. Where the elite meet to drink.
"Eh, yeah, hello, is Mike there? Last name, Rotch."
"Hold on, I'll check. Mike Rotch. Mike Rotch. Hey, has anybody seen Mike Rotch, lately?"
"Listen you little puke. One of these days I'm gonna catch you, and I'm gonna carve my name on your back with an ice pick."
What's the matter Homer? You're not your normal effervescent self.
"I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one."
"hey, you should not drink to forget your problems."
"Yeah, you should only drink to enhance your social skills."
"We'll get the Simpsons a present, an extravagant present! A mad, unthinkable, utterly impossible present! A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present!"
"Ooo, too practical."
Too cutesy-poo.
Too cornball.
A pool table? Are you mad? I'm not gonna turn his home into a saloon.
Eureka! We've found it!
"B-but, sir... it's thirty-two thousand dollars."
Don't you dare sully this moment with your price taggery! It's perfect!
"Oh, woe is me."
"Oh, my! It's Mr. Burns."
Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
"Wait, Dad, he's smiling."
"Mr. Burns, you brought us a present."
"Why, what did you think I was going to do -- have you beaten to a bloody pulp?"
"To show there's no hard feelings, please take an advance copy of my book, ""Will There Ever Be A Rainbow?"" And now, young fellow, I haven't forgotten you. Here."
Wow! A crowbar!
"It's to open the crate, stupid."
"What did I tell you? I'll bet it's filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls..."
Wow! A big ugly head!
"Actually, son, it's a big, ugly Olmec Indian head. It was carved by Meso-American Indians over 3,000 years ago. This gruesome customer is Xt'tapalatakettle, the god of war."
"No, Maggie. Not Az-tec. Ol-mec. Ol-mec."
what does it do?
It doesn't do anything.
"Marge! Really, what does it do?"
"Whatever it does, it's doing it now."
"Well, I'll let you get acquainted with SeÃƒÂ±or Xt'tapalatakettle. Ta!"
"Did you see their faces, Smithers?"
"Sir, you're my god of generosity."
"Save a guy's life, and whattaya get? Nothin'! Worse than nothin'! Just a big, scary rock."
"Hey, man, don't bad-mouth the head."
"it's the thought that counts. The moral of this story is, ""A good deed is its own reward."""
"Hey, we got a reward. The head is cool!"
"Well then, I guess the moral is, ""No good deed goes unrewarded."""
"Wait a minute. If I hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't have gotten anything!"
"Well... then I guess the moral is, ""The squeaky wheel gets the grease."""
Perhaps there is no moral to this story.
Exactly. It's just a bunch of stuff that happened.
But it certainly was a memorable few days!
Amen to that!
"Bart... Bart... Hey, Bart."
Lisa? It's six a.m. Something's wrong! Dad died!
"No, no. He's fine."
"Well, what do you know? I'm relieved."
my birthday is in two days. I'm gonna be eight years old. It's a big number -- almost double digits.
"Well, enjoy it while you can. Everything changes when you hit the big one-oh. Your legs start to go... candy doesn't taste as good anymore --"
Lisa did it.
will you please let me pour my little heart out?
"Sorry, this old timer does ramble on sometimes, don't he?"
"I do so much for you and yet you have disappointed me on every one of my birthdays. I've made things for you. But you've lost or broken them in hours... but, okay, we'll forget all..."
"Okay, uh-huh. Okay, okay,. Okay, okay, okay okay, it's done! I'm doing it! Birthday gift coming your way!"
"Oh, thank you."
watch Maggie while I get the laundry.
Can do.
Hm... Krusty hotline.
"Hi kids! You've reached the Krusty Hotline. If you haven't asked your parents' permission, naughty naughty! But Krusty forgives you! Two dollars for the first minute, fifty cents for each additional minute."
Thanks for calling kids! A new message every day.
I asked you to watch your sister!
I tried to stop her but she overpowered me.
Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt?
I washed it.
"Oh thank you, Marge -- Pink?"
I can't wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirts. I'm not popular enough to be different.
Now  don't panic. You have plenty of white shirts.
"Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!"
"Oh no... Pink. Pink! PINK! It's all over, Marge. It's all over."
I don't know how this could have happened.
"Ah, my lucky red hat. Clean as a whistle!"
You! You did this to me!
please. No one's going to notice if you wear a pink shirt to work.
"Wait a minute, go back. Zoom in. Why is that man in pink?"
"Oh, that's Homer  sir. He's one of your boobs from Sector 7-G."
"eh? Well, judging by his outlandish attire, he's some sort of free-thinking anarchist."
"I'll call security, sir."
Excellent. These color monitors have already paid for themselves.
Hey  we saved you a doughnut.
It has pink frosting!
"Mmm, thanks -- It looks... Hey, wait a minute! Just because I'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean I'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! Although it is tempting --"
Drop that doughnut.
"Let's go, Pinky."
You don't understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry...
Spare me the tired semantics of the Simpson family! Take him away!
"You know, Mr. Burns, his body cavity search revealed nothing and we must have x-rayed him a hundred times. Maybe he's telling the truth."
"Or perhaps you two are in cahoots. Smithers, I seem to recall you had a penchant for bell-bottom trousers back in '79."
"Uh, sir, that was my costume from the plant production of H.M.S. Pinafore."
"Oh, yes, of course. Your spirited hornpipe stole the show, as I recall. Now Doctor, what shall we do about our free wheeling fop over here?"
"Well, Monty, it used to be that establishing a patient's sanity took months. That's all changed, thanks to the ""Marvin Monroe Take Home Personality Test."" Twenty simple questions that will determine just how crazy or meshuggenah, someone is."

"Honey, do me a favor. Fill out this form."
this is an intimate psychological profile. I can't fill this out for you.
"All right, all right. I'll get Lisa to do it."
you like homework. Could you fill out this form for me?
LISA IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY /
"Well, all right -- if you listen to the poem I just wrote."
"Meditations on turning eight, by Lisa Simpson. I had a cat named Snowball -- She died, she died! Mom said she was sleeping -- She lied, she lied! Why oh why is my cat dead? Couldn't that Chrysler hit me, instead? I had a hamster named Snuffy -- He died, --"
No deal.
"Dad, maybe you should do this."
"Son, it's no different than the time I let you vote for me. Remember that absentee ballot?"
"Oh, yeah."
"Our $50,000 Home Video Finalists are: ""Man Breaking Hip."""
Dog on Fire. Ruff! Anybody order a hot dog?
Look at him!
"And finally, ""Baby With A Nail Gun."""
"Okay, it's time to cast your votes now."
Dog on Fire! Dog on Fire!
"Hey, Dad. ""Do you hear voices?"""
"Yes, I'm hearing one right now, while I'm trying to watch TV."
"Yes. ""Are you quick to anger?"""
Bart! Shut up or I'll shut you up!
"Yes. ""Do you wet your pants?"" Well, even the best of us has an occasional accident."
"So, did I pass?"
"Careful, men. He wets his pants."
The devil with his fly open.
That's a spill on a floor with bugs goin' after it. They're gonna eat it.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA /
The boy! This isn't fair! How can you tell who's sane and who's insane?
"Well, we have a very simple method."
Whoever has that stamp on his hand is insane.
Put him in with the big white guy who thinks he's a little black guy.
Who are you?
"Hi. I'm Michael Jackson, from the Jacksons."
I'm Homer  from the Simpsons.
I can't believe you've never heard of me. I'm a very popular entertainer.
"Oh, of course I've heard of you. I mean you'd have to be living under a rock not to know -- what'd you say your name was?"
Michael Jackson.
Doesn't ring a bell.
What was that last one?
"Well, how about this? BILLIE JEAN IS NOT MY LOVER / SHE'S JUST A GIRL WHO SAYS THAT I AM THE ONE / BUT THE KID IS NOT MY SON. HEE, HEE, HEE!"
Wow. How do you do that thing with your feet?
The moonwalk?
"No, that thing with your feet."
Here look. Just raise your heel a bit and put a little pressure on the ball of your foot.
Hee hee hee...
You seem like a nice guy. Why'd they put you in here?
Because I wore a pink shirt.
I understand. People thought I was crazy for the way I dressed.
What'd you wear?
"One white glove, covered with rhinestones."
"in the split second before he died, I bet Scratchy appreciated his birthday present. You see how this relates to us?"
"Hey, you want that once a year empty gesture. You got it, sis."
"Hey, Michael, I don't get it. These guys seem as normal as you and me."
"this is Floyd. He's an idiot savant. Give him any two numbers and he can multiply them in his head, just like that."
Okay. Five times nine.
"We call this guy the Chief. He's been here since 1968. Never says a word, never moves a muscle."
"Hey, Chief."
"Well, it's about time somebody reach out to me."
"Gee, I gotta call my family."
"Oh, this is so embarrassing, calling 'em from a nut house. I mean, they think I'm a god."
I could call them for you.
"Oh great! And uh, try to put a good face on this. Tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight."
"Joe's Crematorium. You kill 'em, we grill 'em."
Hello. Who is this?
I'm Bart  who the hell are you?
I'm Michael Jackson.
The Michael Jackson? No way!
"It's true. I'm with your father, in a mental institution."
Uh-huh. And is Elvis with you?
He could be. It's a big hospital.
"Aw, come on. If you're really Michael Jackson, who were your last four dates for the Grammys?"
"Brooke Shields, Diana Ross, Emmanuel Lewis and Bubbles."
"Shiver me timbers, you are Michael Jackson. Can you stay on the line while I get all my friends and relatives?"
"I'm afraid not, Bart. Your father really needs your help. You don't want him to get a lobotomy, do you?"
"Hmmmm, lobotomy..."
"That's all right, son."
"Well, there's probably a down-size I don't see. Uh-huh... New Bedlam Asylum... loves us... needs us... fears he may never see us again... Got it... Michael Jackson. Whoo-hoo! I love you, man."
"Hey Mom, Dad's in a mental institution."
Oh my God! Mother was right.
Now  don't you worry. Your family's gonna be here before you know it.
"Forget it, pal, there's only one way out of here and it ain't pretty."
Dating a nurse.
I told you kids you were going to send your father to the crazy house.
"No, mom, you said poor house."
I said crazy house!
Poor house.
Crazy house!
"Hello, you've reached the New Bedlam ""Wrongly Committed"" Hotline. All of our operators are currently busy. Please stay on the line."
"What's wrong, Homer?"
"This place is so strange. Mike, I'm ashamed to admit it to another guy, but I'm... scared."
We all get scared once in a while. Maybe I can help you.
"HOMER, THE TWO OF US NEED LOOK NO MORE / WE BOTH FOUND WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR / WITH A FRIEND TO CALL MY OWN / I'LL NEVER BE ALONE / AND YOU MY FRIEND WILL SEE / YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME."
Pancakes... football... Boobies...
"Bubbles, it's gonna be a long night."
I WISH YOU LOVE AND GOOD WILL / I WISH YOU PEACE AND JOY /
Please feel free to express yourselves. In these sessions we want you to feel relaxed and uninhibited.
"Okay, so I was working at an insurance company, right? Huh! Youngest VP in the history of the firm. Okay? The job was my life. Then one Monday morning, I got up and I couldn't leave the house. I just couldn't."
Was the door locked?
"No, I just couldn't face what was out there."
Was it raining?
"No, Homer. Dave suffers from agoraphobia -- a fear of open areas and crowds. Please, Dave, go on."
"Thank you. Anyway, that day I knew I-I just couldn't make that long drive to work."
Were you out of gas?
"Mrs.  I'm sorry but your husband suffers from a persecution complex, extreme paranoia, and bladder hostility."
"Doctor, if you just talked to him for five minutes without mentioning our son,  you'd see how sane he is."
You mean there really is a Bart? Good Lord!
Mmm... pancakes.
"Oh, Mr.  you've got a visitor."
"Oh, Homie."
"Mr.  after talking to your wife, we believe you're no threat to yourself or others."
"That's the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me. Could I have it in writing, please?"
Of course.
Not insane.
"I'm proud of you, Homer."
"Thanks a lot, Michael. You really helped me get through this. If you ever find your marbles, come visit us."
"Well, how about today? I'm only here voluntarily."
You are? Why?
"Well, back in 1979, I got real depressed when my ""Off the Wall"" album just got one lousy Grammy nomination."
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME / HAPPY BIRTHDAY, OVERLOOKED MIDDLE CHILD -- HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME."
"Joe's Taxidermy. You snuff 'em, we stuff 'em."
"Boy, when I get home, I'm going to wrap my hands around your neck --"
"whatever they've got you on, cut the dose."
"Now listen. I'm bringing Michael Jackson home to stay with us for a few days... Isn't that cute -- he's heard of you! Now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice."
Um  I'm a vegetarian. And I don't drink.
Are you sure you're here voluntarily?
Yes. Now  please make sure he doesn't tell anybody I'm coming.
"Yes Dad, I solemnly swear I will not tell another living soul... No, not even Milhouse."
"Hello, Milhouse? Can you keep a secret?"
"Oh well, who cares. Michael Jackson is coming to my house!"
Michael Jackson!
Aunt Bella! Wait a minute. I got a call on the other line. Michael Jackson!
We've just been handed a bulletin from our Rock 'N' Rumor Department.
"That's right, Michael Jackson -- the Thriller himself -- is moonwalkin' his way right here to our very own Spring- field!"
"And while we go check it out, why don't you enjoy our seldom heard, extra longggg version of ""In-a-Gadda-da-Vida."""
Michael Jackson! Oh such a thing happens once in a blue moon. Do I dare to leave my post?
Aye carumba!
"This is the most exciting thing to happen to our fair town since the uh Dalai Lama visited in 1952. And so, I hereby declare that Route 401, currently known as the Dalai Lama Expressway, will henceforth be known as the Michael Jackson Expressway."
"And the guy in the pink shirt is the father of the family who, it turns out, was just released from a mental hospital."
Thanks everybody! It's great to be sane.
Here he is! Here's the guy you wanna see.
Huh? Huh?
He's three hundred pounds.
He's white.
He's dressed without flair.
What the hell made me think Michael Jackson would even visit this jerkwater burg?
You owe us Michael Jackson.
"Don't ever show your face around here again, ya tool."
"the entire town is howling for your blood, and before I join them I have one question: Today is my birthday -- you promised to get me something, and... and I'm afraid to ask."
"You know, maybe you should trust that instinct and not ask."
"I thought so. Oh,  you..."
Come off. I'm sane now.
"Dear  I am using the stationery Mom and Dad gave me for my birthday to inform you that we are now brother and sister in name only. Perhaps if a professional so advises, I will give you a hug at some far distant family reunion, but rest assured it will be purely for show."
"Hey, Bart."
Hey... you.
I WISH YOU BETTER THAN YOUR HEART DESIRE /
"when I was a kid, I didn't have much money. So you know what I did when my sisters' birthdays rolled around?"
Stiffed 'em?
No. I wrote them a song. To show that I cared.
I can't write a song. I'm only ten.
Only ten? When I was your age I had six gold records.
"Hey, Looney Tunes, this is what Michael Jackson looks like. You look like a big fat mental patient."
You'd be amazed how often I hear that.
Just leave me alone.
"Look boy, either Michael Jackson is some guy working in a recording studio in LA or he's here with you willing to work on this song. It's your choice. So long."
"Wait, wait, Michael! You go sit at the piano and I'll boil some coffee."
"LISA, HER TEETH ARE BIG AND GREEN / LISA, SHE SMELLS LIKE GASOLINE / LISA, DA DA DA DEESA / SHE IS MY SIS-TA, HER BIRTHDAY I MISSED-TA."
"Uh, no."
we've got to get to your real feelings about your sister.
I don't have any.
"Well, let's go look at her. Maybe that will help."
"Ah, she looks sad."
That's cause she knows you're looking at her.
"Although I am aware you are looking at me, I would look exactly the same even if you weren't."
think. What happens to you when you turn eight?
"Well, your training wheels come off your bike."
"Good. That's good. THE TRAINING WHEELS COME OFF YOUR BIKE / YOU START TO NOTICE BOYS YOU LIKE...HEE, HEE, HEE."
You're just putting that in because it's commercial.
Lisa... Lisa... Lisa.
Huh... wha--  it's six a.m.
"That's right! Hope you like your present. And a-one, and a-two, and a one, two, three, four --"

"Oh! This is the best present I ever got. Thank you, Bart. Thank you Michael."
"Well, my work is done here."
"Hey, Michael. What happened to your voice?"
"This is my real voice. My name is Leon Kompowski and I'm a brick layer from Patterson, New Jersey. All my life I was very angry until one day I just talked like this. All of a sudden everybody was smiling at me, and I was only doin' good on this earth, so I kept on doin' it. To make a tired point. Which one of us is truly crazy?"
Not me. I got this.
"Bye, bye, Leon / Bye, roomie / Bye, Pardner / You're a credit to Dementia!"
See ya!
LISA IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / GOD BLESS YOU THIS DAY / YOU GAVE-A ME THE GIFT-A DA DOO DA DEE DEE DOO DOO / AND I'M A PROUD OF YOU TODAY!

"Take it away, Lis."
"Stupid junk mail... ""You May Have Already Won!"" Yeah, win this... ""Here's Good News for Homer Simpsoy""... I'll see that he gets it. How dumb do they think I am?"
Huh? A check?
"Mr.  I can assure you this ""check"" of yours is non-negotiable."
"Oh yeah? Well, what makes you so damn sure?"
"You see where it says ""VOID-VOID-VOID"" and ""This Is Not A Check""? ""Cash value one twentieth of a cent""? ""Mr. Banker, do not honor."""
Shut up.
I had a feeling it was too good to be true. Every time you get a million dollars something queers the deal.
I don't think real checks have exclamation points.
"Well, at least we got a free sample of Reading Digest."
I never read a magazine in my life and I'm not gonna start now.
"Hey, a cartoon."
"""Well dear, you always wanted a compact."" -- Ain't it the truth."
"No, it is not the truth, Homer. It's well documented that women are safer drivers than men."
"Oh, Marge. Cartoons don't have any deep meaning. They're just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh."
"Hey, Einstein. Put down your readin', it's lunchtime."
"Nah, you go ahead."
"Hey, You don't wanna eat? What'd ya do, get one of them stomach staples?"
"As Tolstoy said in ""Quotable Notables,"" ""Give me learning, sir, and you may keep your black bread."""
"Who is that bookworm, Smithers?"
Homer  sir.
eh? How very strange. His job description clearly specifies an illiterate.
"We now return to Troy McClure and Delores Montenegro in ""Preacher with a Shovel."""
"But irrigation can save your people, Chief Smiling Bear."
look at them staring at that idiot box. God forbid they would ever read something and improve their minds.
You've certainly taken a shine to that magazine.
"Ooh... How about the ""V""?"
"It's not just one magazine, Marge. They take hundreds of magazines, filter out the crap, and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket."
Those kids don't know what they're missing.
"Hey, what gives, man?"
We're all gonna sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival.
Then I heard the sound that all Arctic explorers dread: The pitiless bark of the sea lion. He'll be killed!
he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article.
Don't be so...
"Oh, you're right."
Homie... Put down your magazine for a minute...
I thought you might want to snuggle.
"That reminds me! ""Seven Ways To Spice Up Your Marriage."""
"you have a nice body. And if you'd like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask."
"Thank you, Homie."
"Wow, little meatloaf men!"
"Where did you get the idea for this, Mom?"
Where do you think? This baby never steers you wrong. And it was free. Free!
It certainly has enriched our lives.
"Wow! ""Win a Trip to Washington D.C.""! ""All expenses paid... VIP tour""... Oh. It's for kids."
"Wait, Dad!"
"Hm. An essay contest. ""Children under twelve""... ""Three hundred words""... ""Fiercely pro-American."" Sounds interesting."
"maybe this is something you'd like to do, too."
"Mom, it's a nice thought, but we both know that this is the pony to bet on."
"What would Ben Franklin say if he were alive today? He'd say... oh, think of a better opening."
"How's it going, honey?"
Not very well.
Ooh... And Miss? Just one more question --
"Well, when I used to get stuck like this, I'd go for a bike ride. Do kids go on bike rides anymore?"
"I don't know, I thought maybe bikes weren't cool anymore. Do kids still use that word, ""cool""?"
"Yes, Mom."
"Okay, America. Inspire me."
"Wow, a bald eagle."
"Thanks for driving me to the contest, Dad."
"Sweetheart, there's nothing I wouldn't do for that magazine."
"""So burn the flag if you must. But before you do, you'd better burn a few other things. You better burn your shirt and your pants. Be sure to burn your TV and car.

"When America was born on that hot July day in 1776, the trees in Springfield Forest were tiny saplings, trembling towards the sun. And as they were nourished by Mother Earth, so too did our fledgling nation find strength in the simple ideals of equality and justice. Who would have thought such mighty oaks, or such a powerful nation, could grow out of something so fragile... so pure. Thank you."
What do you think?
It's good. A little too good for an eight-year-old. Methinks I detect the sickly scent of the daddy.
Mr.  I'd like to ask you a few questions about your daughter's essay.  will you excuse us?
We the purple? What the hell was that?
Are you a professional writer?
Are you interested in politics or government?
Are you interested in anything?
Could you touch your nose for me?
"after meeting your father, I've decided to award you an additional five points. Congratulations. You and your family are going to Washington!"
Woo hoo! Who would've guessed reading and writing would pay off?
"Yes, sir. Can I get you something?"
"Playing cards, notepad, aspirin, sewing kit, pilot's wing pin, propellor-shaped swizzle stick, sleeping mask and anything else I've got coming to me."
I'll see what I can do.
"Little boy, I bet you'd like to visit the cockpit."
Oh baby!
"And this control stick is like the handlebars on your tricycle. Now, would you like to see where we hang our coats?"
"No thank you, I'd rather push this button."
We're all gonna die!
"Look,  that guy has the same last name we do... Taxi!"
"Oooh, look, Homer. The IRS."
"Oh, boo yourself!"
"Here we are, kids! The Watergate."
Uh... okay.
"look! They give you a shower cap, and body gel and bathrobes... Ooh, and a welcoming mint on your pillow."
Wowww -- A shoehorn! Just like in the movies!
"Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off."
"Hey, I call first bedsies!"
Bart! There's no such thing as first bedsies. You just made that up.
"Well, okay, which one do you want?"
Iiiiiii Waaaaaannt... That one.
"Really, you want that one? It's all yours. Whatever you say."
Why? What's wrong with it?
"Nothing! Have a good night's sleep, Lisa."
"No, really, what?"
What did you do to it?
Stupid welcoming mint! Y'ello.
Good morning. This is your wake-up call.
Wake-up call? It's two AM!
Sorry fatso.
Free food?!
"Lisa? I'm Faith Crowley, Patriotism Editor of Reading Digest."
"Ooh! I love your magazine. My favorite section is ""How To Increase Your Word Power."" That thing is really, really, really good."
Well... good.
I'd like you to meet some of the other finalists. This is Truong Van Dinh and Maria Dominguez.
"Maria is the national spelling bee champion, and Truong has won both the Westinghouse Talent Search and the NFL Punt, Pass and Kick Competition."
Have either of you ever run into any problems because of your superior ability?
"Sure, I guess."
"Ah, me too!"

Mmmmmm... Money.
"Hey, watch it, chief!"
"Folks, we print more than eighteen million bills a day. Oh, and in case you were wondering... no we, we don't give out free samples."
Lousy cheap country...
BART! Get out of the Spirit of St. Louis!
"Hey, what's so funny?"
Oh  grow up.
"Congressman, this is Springfield National Forest."
"Now basically, what we want to do is cut her down."
Huh uh.
"As you can see in our artist's rendition it's full of old growth, just aging and festering away. In comes our logging company... to thin out the clutter. It's all part of nature's, y'know, cycle."
"Well Jerry, you're a whale of a Lobbyist And I'd like to give you a logging permit. I would, but uh, this isn't like burying toxic waste. People are gonna notice those trees are gone."
"Uh, Congressman... this is where it gets awkward, I... I never quite know how to put this... I just want to..."
...Offer me a bribe?
Ohhh... What is it?
It's that little girl from Springfield who wrote the essay. Could be a good photo op.
"Uh, sure, fine."
"So, where do we..."
Not here. I've got a little place that I use for these uh... matters. Call me tonight.
Well hi there! You must be Lisa Simpson.
"Hello, sir."
"you're a doer. And who knows, maybe some day you'll be a congressman or a senator. We have quite a few women senators, you know."
Only two. I checked.
"You're a sharp one. Well, how about a few pictures?"
A tot shot always plays in the sticks.
"Ah, isn't that nice. Now, there is a politician who cares."
"If I ever vote, it'll be for him."
the contest isn't for three hours.
I'm too excited to sleep. Anyone up for the Winifred Beecher Howe Memorial?
Who's that?
An early crusader for women's rights. She led the Floormop Rebellion of 1910. Later she appeared on the highly unpopular 75 cent piece.
"Okay, but you don't know what you're missing."
"""I will iron your sheets when you iron out the inequities in your labor laws."" Amen, sister."
I told you no one ever came here.
"So, Bob, where do we stand on Springfield Forest? Do I get my logging permit?"
"Well, let me put it this way, Jerry... Tim-berrr!"
"Ugh, what a pooch."
Woof woof!
How could I read my essay now? I don't believe my own words.
Honest Abe. He'll show me the way.

"Miss Crowley, thank you for this over-sized novelty check. I would like to share this honor with all of my fellow essayists. Particularly the courageous Lisa  whose inflammatory rhetoric reminded us that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance."
Give her the check!
I was serious.
"SAY, LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT LISA S. / SHE'S THE LITTLE EIGHT-YEAR-OLD MUCKRAKER-ESS / SHE CAUGHT A CROOK AND REALLY MADE HIM PAY / SHE DID IT ALL IN JUST ONE DAY / THAT'S WHAT I WOULD CALL / BEING ON THE BALL!"
"Lis, you taught me to stand up for what I believe in."
Why  you silly goose! The weed whacker's just for the edges! You're gonna be out here all day!
I'm almost done.
"You are a picture and a half! Well -- hee hee! -- if you're finished by tomorrow, come on over and strap on the feed bag. We're gonna fire up old Propane Elaine and put the heat to the meat! Nummy nummy num!"
I'll be there. Not-y not-y not.
The Flanders are having a beef-a-thon! Incredible Ned-ibles! Maude-acious vittles!.
I think it means he's having a barbecue.
"Well, why doesn't he just say so?"
"He's trying to be friendly. You know, if you gave Ned Flanders a chance --"
"Oh, here we go again. Look, I don't care if Ned Flanders is the nicest guy in the world, he's a jerk. End of story."
"We can't hold it against him, just because he has things a little better than we do --"
"Excuse me? Better? Thanks a lot,  you really put me in my place."
"Don't get me wrong, it's worth feeling three inches tall to find out what kind of a person you really are. Marge Simpson... President of the International We Love Flanders Fan Club..."
Fee fi fo fum! I smell the potatoes au gratin of Marge Simp-son! Mmmm- mmm!
"Hi, Ned. Homer sends his apologies, but uh... there was some important work at the plant that only he could take care of."
We now return you to the exciting fifteenth round action at the Canadian Football League draft.
"And so the Saskatchewan Rough Riders, who scored only four rouges all last season, Jack, get the kicker they so sorely need..."
"Stupid Flanders... always showing off. Go ahead,  have a ball... What if they game back and I was dead from not eating? They'd cry their eyes out. We should have never gone to the Flanders'. Oh, why did we go to the Flanders' house and leave Homer all alone with no food. And I'd be laughing. Laughing from my grave."
"What is it, boy? What? Mmmmmmmm... bar-b-que."
"Hey, everyone, I'm back! Great to see ya! Nice seein' ya!"
"Heya, Homer!"
"Okay, thanks for comin'!"
"You're ""it""!"
No electricity. Electricity only in freeze tag.
"Okay... Now you're ""it""!"
"Hey, no tagbacks."
"Yeah, you cheater!"
You lie like a fly with a booger in its eye.
The fly was funny and a booger was the icing on the cake...
"Friends, we love you all, but I also have a ""sinister"" motive for asking you all here -- ""sinister"" being Latin for ""left-handed."" But enough joking."
That was a joke?
"As of Friday, I'm saying toodle-oo to the pharmaceutical game."
"No, I kid you not. Here's the noose I had to wear for ten years."
"What are you going to do, Ned?"
"Well sir, like one out of every nine Americans, I'm left-handed. And let me tell you, it ain't all peaches and cream. Your writing gets smeared. Lord help you if you want to drive a standard transmission."
"Well sir, I'm opening a one-stop store for Southpaws. Everything from left-handed apple peelers to left-handed zithers. I'm gonna call it the Leftorium."
So  I'm dyin' to know. What do you think of the Leftorium?
Uh... Sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me.
"Well, I know it's a little risky and it's gonna be a lot of hard work, but gosh darn it, it's gonna be a lot of fun, too."
"Fun? Where is this store, Flanders? The merry old land of Oz?"
"Oh, no. The Springfield Mall."
"Oh, here, you two. Make a wish."
It's fun.
"No, it isn't."
"You must have something you want to wish for, Homer."
"Hmm, let's see."
"Come on, Homer! I got an ambition to do some wishin'!"
"Keep your pants on, Flanders! I'm wishing as fast as I can!"
Mmmm -- too far.
Okay. Ready.
Yesssss! Oh yessss! Read it and weep. In your face. I've got more chicken bone!
"What'd you wish for, Homer?"
"No, no, no, don't say. Otherwise it won't come true."
Oooh. That would be a shame.
"Wouldn't it, Flanders?"
how many hours a day do you watch TV?
Six. Seven if there's something good on.
Don't you think you should get a little fresh air and maybe some exercise?
"Yeah, but what are ya gonna do?"
TV gives so much and asks so little. It's a boy's best friend.
"That's the problem. Even as we speak, millions of children are staring at the TV instead of getting some much-needed exercise. Those children's parents should be ashamed of themselves."
"Hello, I am Akira. HA!"
That didn't hurt very much because I know the ancient art of karate.
Karate focuses the mind and gives one self-confidence.
People from all walks of life... doctors...
... homemakers...
... landscape architects...
... choreographers...
"High karate at low, low prices."
"I cannot tell a lie, this is a great deal."
"Hey Mom, how 'bout if I learn karate? Will that we make you happy?"
"That sounds fine, Bart."
"See, Marge? You knock TV and then it helps you out. I think you owe somebody a little apology."
"Well, if it isn't the Leftorium."
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
"Hey Flanders, how's business?"
"Oh, a little pokey, but things are gonna pick up."
I am so sorry. How much do I owe you?
"Now, you put that money away. That was an accident."
"Really? Well, thanks. Could you validate my parking?"
Absotively posilutely.
"So, Flanders, have you sold anything?"
N-Not yet. But one of the mall security guards took a good long look at a left-handed ice cream scoop.
"Greetings. I am Akira, your guide on the path to true karate. And this is our map, the Art of War by Sun Tzu. It will teach us our most important lesson: we learn karate so that we need never use it."
"Um, excuse me, sir. I already know how not to hit a guy. Can we break out the nunchucks?"
"Ah, yes, the impetuousness of youth! For now, let us read."
"Akira, my good man. When do we break blocks of ice with our heads?"
First you must fill your head with wisdom. Then you can hit ice with it.
"Yo, sensei, can I go to the bathroom?"
"You can, if you believe you can."
Paying money to read books... the hell with this.
"Come on, Touch of death. Touch of death. Touch of death."
Touch of death!
"I'm telling you, Flanders' store was dee-serted. So what do you think of your bestest buddy now, Marge?"
"Dad, do you know what Schadenfreude is?"
"No, I do not know what Schadenfreude is. Please tell me, because I'm dying to know."
"It's the German term for ""shameful joy"" -- taking pleasure in the suffering of others."
"Oh, come on, Lisa. I'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt. He's usually all happy and comfortable and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel... What's the opposite of that shameful joy thing of yours?"
Sour grapes.
"Boy, those Germans have a word for everything."
So  what did you learn in karate school today?
"Yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks."
"Uh, I learned the touch of death."
"Ooh, the touch of death."
Permit me to demonstrate.  shut your eyes. Soon you will be at peace.
"Hey, quit it, Bart. Quit it! Hey, quit it, quit it, quit it! M-o-o-o-m!"
don't use the touch of death on your sister.
Uh-oh. Gotta get back to karate class.
You missed a spot.
"All right. Comin' through. Outta my way. Move it along. Step aside, lady."
"Hey, boy. How was class?"
Today we learned how to rip a man's heart out and show it to him before he dies.
"Oh, that'll learn 'im."
What'd ya swipe?
"An ""I Love Lefties"" shot glass."
Left-handed pinking shears.
Pinking shears? Let's go to the Food Court and steal some baked potatoes.
"Hey Flanders, when are your busy hours?"
"Oh, oh, oh, I expect things to start picking up soon. I think word of mouth is startin' to spread."
"Hey, I hear you validate parking tickets without purchase."
"Oh, right as rain. Or, as we say around here, left as rain."
Just stamp the ticket.
"Uh, okay."
Hey  how's your neighbor's store doing?
Lousy. He just sits there all day. He'd have a great job if he didn't own the place.
Crummy right-handed corkscrews! What does he sell?
"Uh, well actually, Moe..."
I dunno.
"Hey, Lis. Change the channel."
You change it.
"Okay, okay."
I grow weary of this new channel. Change it back.
But Bart --
"Apple, apple, apple... Come on candy bar. Hey, I know you! You're that first apple I didn't want. That sinks it. I'm really gonna let 'em have it this time!"
"put that box on Mr. Burns' desk. Chop, chop!"
"Ah! Look, Smithers, another member of our nuclear family, with some helpful suggestions. And what's your name?"
eh? Hmm hmmm. I'm Monty Burns.
"Hm. ""Keep that handsome owner out of sight. He's distracting the female employees."" Smithers..."
"Got me, sir."
"Oh! It's a real one! ""No more apples in the vending machine, please."" Well, that's almost a sentence!"
"Can I leave, Mr. Burns?"
"Oh, of course. And don't worry, there'll be plenty of apples for you. Nobody will take away your precious apples."
But the note was asking you to --
"Now, now, now. Tell my secretary I said you could have a free apple. She'll make everything all right, I promise."
Damned infernal gizmo. My kingdom for a left-handed can opener!
"Um, Mr. Burns..."
"Come on, Homer. Tell him about the store. I'm dyin' out here."
"Sorry, Flanders."
Are you sure you're not interested? Two hundred dollars is only the asking price.
"Sorry, Ned."
"Hey, I'm flexible! You don't have to pay all at once. I'll be here all night if you change your mind."
"Hey, Flanders. Is everything okay?"
"Oh, yeah. Sure. Thought I'd just get rid of some of the clutter. See anything you like?"
"Oh, I get it. It's not good enough for you, but it's good enough for me! Well, I wouldn't be caught dead buying this... Hello!"
"Ah, got your eye on the gas grill. She's a butane beaut."
I'll give you twenty bucks for it.
Twenty?  I paid three hundred dollars for this just last year.
"You were swindled, my friend. Twenty bucks. Take it or leave it."
"Oh,  be reasonable."
Sorry! No cash for Neddie! Homer keep all money! Bye bye Neddie! Bye bye!
"All right, Homer."
Twenty dollars?
Twenty dollars.
Now I don't want it.
"I changed my mind. It was a passing fancy. Although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest."
"Hey, Bartle- eeboobely, care for a steak-a-rooney?"
"Sounds scrump-didly-umptious, dear old Daddly-doodly."
this is the Flanders' entire living room set. How much did you pay for this?
Only seventy-five beans!
Seventy-five dollars? Ned must be desperate!
"I'm sure you did nothing to discourage this, you scavenger of human misery."
"Hey, keep your hands off my china hutch."
"Good afternoon, sir, I'm Chuck Ellis from the Springfield Collection Agency, and I'm here to ask you why you don't think you need to pay your bills."
"Oh, I know I need to pay them. But there's just so many."
"Does it make you feel good about yourself to owe people money? We've been very patient with you, Mr. Flanders."
"I know, but... Wait a minute. I'm Homer Simpson. Ned Flanders lives over there."
Flanders is in debt? Are you sure?
We don't make mistakes.
Damn right-handed ledgers... can't write in these things...
"Uh, there's a store where..."
"Hey, you said you're Homer Simpson?"
See you on Thursday.
"Knock 'em dead, boy! Kid's gonna be a black belt in no time."
"Hey, check out the saxophone!"
"Pretty boss, but there's something stuck on it."
"Hey, look at me -- I'm Elvis, man."
You give that back. That belongs to me! That's mine!
"If you want it, just take it."
Okay. We're sorry. This time we're really gonna give it to you.
"Hey, stop that."
"Hey Lis, something wrong?"
Not any more. You punks are about to get a taste of your own medicine. This is my brother... and he knows Karate.
"Oh, we're real scared."
"Please don't hurt us, Bart!"
"What are you gonna do, throw your diapers at us?"
"Yeah, just keep laughing, it only makes him madder. Come on,  start them off with the touch of death and go from there."
"I think they've learned their lesson already, Lis."
"No, we want to see the touch of death."
"Yeah, come on Karate kid. Waste me!"
It's funny how two wrongs sometimes make a right.
Homer! Over here!
"Oh, Flanders, I, uh, want to give you your stuff back."
"Well, there's no house to put it in,  not since that nice fellow from the bank, who was only doing his job, came and locked it up."
You're gonna live in your car?
"Oh, oh, no, it's just a little campout tonight, then off to my sister's apartment in Capital City. Hey what do think, kids? The big city!"
"Say, Todd, I want to talk to your Uncle Homer. You're head of the car till I get back."
"Okay, Dad. GRAY SKIES ARE GONNA CLEAR UP /"
PUT ON A HAPPY FACE / BRUSH OFF THE CLOUDS AND CHEER UP / PUT ON A HAPPY FACE /
TAKE OFF THE GLOOMY MASK OF TRAGEDY / IT'S NOT YOUR STYLE / YOU'LL LOOK SO GOOD THAT YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DECIDED TO SMILE / TAKE OUT A PLEASANT OUTLOOK / STICK OUT THAT NOBLE CHIN / WIPE OUT THAT FULL OF DOUBT LOOK / PUT ON A HAPPY GRIN / AND SPREAD SUNSHINE / ALL OVER THE PLACE / JUST PUT ON A HAPPY FACE.
Listen to that singing... those poor fools.  I'm ruined.
I know!
"You know at times like these, I-I used to turn to the Bible and find solace. But even the good book can't help me now."
Why not?
I sold it to you for seven cents.
"You know, ever since that barbecue, nothing's gone right. It's like there's been a-a curse on me."
"Oh, it's all my fault."
No it's not.
Yes it is.
No! You tried to warn me about gambling my family's future on some pig in a poke... I didn't listen.  you were a true friend.
"No, I was a swine."
"Listen, Flanders, do you still have that store?"
For two more days. Then it becomes Libertarian Party headquarters. I hope they have better luck than I did.
"Flanders, you open that store tomorrow!"
"Oh,  there's no point..."
I SAID DO IT!
"Hello, Jerry? Homer Simpson. Remember last month, when I paid back that loan? Well, now I need you to do a favor for me."
"A left-handed corkscrew? Oh, baby!"
"""Kiss Me, I'm Left-Handed""? That's a classic!"
Homer Simpson's on the phone.
Tell him I went out.
He needs you to help Ned Flanders.
Ned Flanders is in trouble!?
"Smithers, I'm licked. You open this can."
"Okay, but you softened it up for me, sir."
"Hold it, Smithers! I'll open the can!"
"But sir, how?"
To the mall! I'll explain on the way!
"Hurry, Neddie, hurry! Oh golly, it's a miracle!"
"C'mon, you lefties. What'd I tell you?"
"It's all here, and it's all backwards. That's right."
"The world has turned has it not my tin-plated friend? Look at you -- you, who were once so proud -- Feel the wrath of the left hand of Burns!"
My life begins today!
Wow! What an icebreaker!
Left-handed ledgers! Now I can write all the way to the edge!
Ah ha ha... left-handed Nunchuks.
"The boys at the Diners Club will think I've gone quite mad. Oh, and I'll have that roadster in the corner as well."
"Yes, sir!"
Huzzah for the shopkeep!
affordable tract housing made us neighbors. But you made us friends.
To Ned Flanders... the richest left- handed man in town.
Everybody! GREY SKIES ARE GONNA CLEAR UP /
STICK OUT THAT NOBLE CHIN / WIPE OFF THAT FULL OF DOUBT LOOK / SLAP ON A HAPPY GRIN / AND SPREAD SUNSHINE ALL OVER THE PLACE / JUST PUT ON A HAPPY FACE!
Good mornin' world!
Good morning Lisa!
What are you so happy about?
"Why shouldn't I be happy? It's a beautiful day, my homework is done, I've got my mojo workin' and we're goin' on a field trip this afternoon."
And... looks like I got me a genuine glow-in-the-dark police badge.
Hey! It's not in here. You stole it!
"No one wants your stupid police badge, Bart."
"Hey, look what I got. A genuine official police badge... Calling all cars... come out with your hands up!"
"Hey, that's my badge, Homer."
"That's Officer Homer. Heh heh, heh, heh."
... Lousy prize-grabbing... badge-wearing...
You ate my homework?
I didn't know dogs really did that.
Wait! Wait!
Bart Simpson! You're late! Go fill out a tardy slip.
But I'm only... ... ... five... ten... twenty... forty minutes? That's pretty damn late.
Hey girls! Look at me!
You can stop lookin' at me now.
"Well, it's nearly one o'clock. And you know what that means."
My glasses.
That's right. It's time for our field trip to the chocolate factory. I trust you all remembered to bring your permission slips.
What a day.
I'm gonna eat EIGHT pieces of chocolate.
I'm gonna eat chocolate till I barf.
"Don't worry,  we'll find something fun for you to do."
Ah! Here we are! Here's a whole box of unsealed envelopes for the PTA.
You're making me lick envelopes?
"Oh, licking envelopes can be fun! All you have to do is make a game of it."
What kind of game?
"Well... for example... you could see how many you can lick in an hour, and then try to break that record."
Sounds like a pretty crappy game to me.
Yes... well... get started.
Oh my God. It's Cocoa Beanie himself.
I think this is something Bart would really have enjoyed. But it's the only way he'll learn.
"Welcome to the chocolate factory. I'm Troy McClure. You probably remember me from such films as ""The Revenge of Abe Lincoln"" and ""The Wackiest Covered Wagon in the West."" The history of chocolate starts with the ancient Aztecs."
"In those days, instead of being wrapped in a hygienic package, chocolate was wrapped in a tobacco leaf."
"And instead of being pure chocolate like we have today, it was mixed with shredded tobacco. And they didn't eat it. They smoked it."
"You didn't believe me when I said it would be fun, did you?"
No thir.
"Please, kids, play sanitary."
Tan Die Doe Dow?
Tan... Die.... Doe... Dow.
"Hmm... Well there's still a minute to go... oh, why not! But don't you tell your teacher I let you go home early."
Die don't.
What next?
"Hey, what's with the kid?"
Hands off the material!
Whaddaya know! The kid's tough.
He's got spunk.
"I wonder if he is lucky also. Pick a horse, kid. Shelbyville Downs. Third race. Make it a good one."
Eat my shorts.
"Eat my shorts. Ah, okay. Let's see... Heyy... Wait a minute, you little punk! Eat My Shorts is in the fifth race. I said the third race!"
Don't have a cow.
"Hmm... ""Don't have a cow"" in the third. Put a deuce on him."
"While we are waiting to see how lucky you are, let me show you around. This is our bar, and over there is our slot machine and card tables...."
Hey Boss! Here's the call for the third race.
"...As they come out of the turn it's ""Sufferin Succotash"" by a neck over ""Yabbadabbadoo."" Two lengths back to ""Ain't I a Stinker"" and ""That's All Folks."" ""I Yam What I Yam"" can see them all. But here comes ""Donhavacow"" flyin' on the outside. And at the wire it's all ""Donhavacow!"""
"Hey, I like this kid. I can't believe we were gonna shoot him. Can you mix drinks?"
I'll have a Manhattan.
Make Legs a Manhattan.
I'm not sure I...
You got a job? Doing what?
"Oh... I dunno... mixing drinks, picking horses, cuttin' cigars... you know -- a job."
your father and I don't want you doing that.  say something.
How much does it pay?
Thirty bucks a week.
Pfft. I make more than that.
"I was lookin' for those. Thanks, doll."
It's funny because it's true.
Well obsoived.
"Chief Wiggum, you honor us with your presence."
Baloney. I'm not gonna rest until one of us is behind bars -- You! You wouldn't happen to know anything about a cigarette truck that got hijacked on route 401?
What's a truck?
Don't play dumb with me!
"Relax Chief, you seem tense. You know, the boy here makes an excellent Manhattan."
"Ah... I'm still gonna put you away, you know."
"Good for you, Chief."
... Bart! Have you started smoking?
Don't lie to me boy.
"Aha! Cigarettes, just as I thought."
They're not mine. My boss said his warehouse was full.
"Yeah, right. Son... I'm gonna teach you a lesson. I'm going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. Then maybe you'll learn..."
Uh... Fat Tony sent me over to pick up the goods.
Right in here my man.
"Hey kid, you look good with that cigarette. Kind of sophisticated."
"Son, I'll never doubt you again."
The contents of the hijacked truck: some twelve thousand cartons of Laramie 100's.
Homer? Homer!
"We have... uh... Please, we have a number of leads. And let me assure all you smokers out there... there is no shortage of cigarettes."
How do we know that?
"All right, let me refer that question back to Jack Larson, of Laramie Tobacco Products. Jack?"
"Thank you Chief. Folks, I'm pleased to announce that a new truckload of Laramies with their smooth good taste and rich tobacco flavor is already heading towards Springfield. And the driver has been instructed to ignore all stop signs and crosswalks."
"The police suspect the involvement of reputed mobster William ""Fat Tony"" Williams."
Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city. He is the cancer and I am the... uh... ... what cures cancer?
is your boss a crook?
I don't think so. Although it would explain an awful lot.
Me and the boys wish to thank you for hanging onto this stuff for us.
"Thanks... uh... Say, are you guys crooks?"
um... is it wrong to steal a loaf of bread to feed your starving family?
"Well, suppose you got a large starving family. Is it wrong to steal a truckload of bread to feed them?"
"And what if your family don't like bread, they like cigarettes?"
I guess that's okay.
"Now, what if instead of giving them away, you sold them at a price that was practically giving them away. Would that be a crime, Bart?"
Hell no!
Enjoy your gift.
"THOSE FINGERS THROUGH MY HAIR / THAT SLY COME HITHER STARE / THAT STRIPS MY CONSCIENCE BARE / IT'S WITCHCRAFT - GIMME THREE FINGERS OF MILK, MA."
"I know it's good for a boy to have a part-time job, but I'm not sure about the people Bart's working for. I thinks they're criminals."
The kiss of death. That's all I need!
"A job's a job. I mean, take me. If my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town, by your logic that would make me a criminal."
"Well, Bart's been acting very strangely. And that pizza delivery truck has been parked across the street for two weeks."
How long does it take to deliver a pizza?
Looks like our cover's blown.
Let's roll.
See? It was all your imagination.
"I want you to go down to that club and talk to them. Just see what kind of people they are. Please, Homie?"
"Oh, all right."
"Hee hee, hee-hee-hee! Read 'em and weep boys, another pair of sixes."
Beats me.
I was bluffin'.
"You win again, Homer."
I am thrilled you've decided to let your boy continue to work here.
"You know if you need a hat check girl, I've got a daughter."
you're a hellava father.
what did you find out?
the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding.
"More ""stink lines"" boys."
What's this? What are you boys doing?
You ain't seen nothin'. Now beat it.
"So, Fat Tony. You invite me and my associates to your club with the promise of the finest Manhattans in all of Springfield. Now you say your bartender isn't here?"
I don't know what happened. He's never late. Louie! Make up some Manhattans.
But I only know how to make wine spritzers.
"What have I done to deserve this flat, flavorless Manhattan?"
"Come on, boys."
Lousy Skinner.
You are late for work.
Of course I'm late for work. How can I be on time when Principal Skinner keeps me after school?
This guy Skinner causing you trouble?
"He sure is, Patrone."
"Hm... perhaps we should go to meet and greet this individual. Come on, boys."
"Some large men to see you, sir."
I don't have an appointment with any large men --
You Skinner?
"I'm PRINCIPAL Skinner, yes. And how, may I ask, did you get past the hall monitors?"
"Children, I don't know how to break this to you, but Principal Skinner is... ... MISSING!"
I thought I found him but it was only a cat.
"Now please... Please, please, I can assure you we'll be using the most advanced, scientific techniques in the field of... body finding."
I see wedding bells for Vanna White and Teddy Kennedy....
"Please, Princess Opal, if we could just stick to Principal Skinner."
"Chief Wiggum, I am merely a conduit for the spirits. Willie Nelson will astound his fans by swimming the English Channel."
Really? Willie Nelson?
He loved fire drills.
"Will ya get a hold of yourself, Lass, for the wee bairns!"
Hey look at me! I'm Skinner's body!
"That is not funny, Lewis."
"Well, I heard Skinner's buried under his parking spot."
I heard he was ground up into hamburger and served to us at lunch.
I heard Bart had Skinner killed by gangsters.
That's not true! It's just a rumor! You're engaged in speculation. I know the law. You can't prove anything.
You killed me Bart.
"You killed me, Bart!"
"You k-killed me, Bart!"
Reverend Lovejoy! You've... you've come to comfort me?
"Yes, Bart. ... There there... there there..."
Kill my boy! Kill my boy!
You're eight hours early for work. I like that.
Did you kill my principal?
Uh... Chinese guy with a mustache?
No! My principal!
"That Skinner guy? Naw, we didn't kill him."
Nobody move! You're all under arrest for the murder of Seymour Skinner.
What's a murder?
"Don't play dumb with me. Cuff 'em, boys."
"Oh, Bart. Why couldn't you have gotten a paper route like other boys."
"Wait till I get you home, boy."
What's that guy doing here?
"Lionel Hutz, court-appointed attorney. I'll be defending you on the charge of -- Murder one?! Wow, even if I lose I'll be famous!"
That Simpson boy is looking at a hundred and eighty years.
"Yeah, you're right."
Thank God we live in a country so hysterical over crime that a ten-year-old child can be tried as an adult.
I didn't order this Skinner guy killed.
But aren't you the head of this gang?
"No, I just stop by the club occasionally to read the complimentary newspaper."
Then who is the Kingpin... the Capo de tuti Capi?
That's the guy.
"Forgive me, Don Bartholomew."
"We tried to stop the kid, but he wouldn't quit. It was like he went crazy."
"Prostitution, loan sharking, numbers. The kid liked to wet his beak in everything."
Mr.  you've been the boy's father for ten years. Do you really think he could be the leader of a murderous criminal syndicate?
"Well, not the leader... I mean... Oh, it's true, it's true! All the pieces fit."
"In light of the damning testimony from your fellow gangsters, your father, your teachers and a seemingly endless parade of emotionally shattered baby-sitters, this court has no choice but to..."
Principal Skinner!
I thought he was dead.
"I suppose you're all wondering where I've been. It all started a week ago. I was at my desk, revising and updating the school dress codes, when..."
I was suddenly confronted by a gang of toughs acting on behalf of one Bart Simpson. Or so they said.
We really think there's promise in the boy.
Get out!
"Okay, okay, you don't have to yell."
To get my mind off that ugly confrontation I went home and began bundling my old newspapers. But suddenly the pile fell. I was trapped. Let this be a lesson to recycle frequently.
"Eww, lemon... ugh, cherry... hmm, custard... mmm, purple."
"For the next week I stayed alive by eating my mother's delicious preserves and maintained my sanity by dribbling a nearby basketball with my one free hand. I made a game of it, seeing how many times I could bounce the ball in a day, then trying to break that record. Occasionally the police arrived to search my home."
"Find anything this time, boys?"
"Nah... no sign of him, chief."
Princess Opal?
I see nothing here but I'm afraid it's splitsville for Delta Burke and Major Dad.
But they seemed so happy.
"I shouted until I was hoarse, but they couldn't hear me."
I'M IN HERE!!!
"Well, let's go."
"Okay, Chief."
"Finally I realized if I was ever going to get out of there, I would have to do it myself."
"I formed a crude rocket from a discarded cigar tube. And remembering an experiment from my days as a fourth grade science teacher, I concocted a fuel from baking soda and the juice of discarded lemon wedges."
"The rocket took off with a mighty blast of carbon dioxide, dragging behind it the end of a vacuum cleaner cord."
"I grabbed on to the vacuum cleaner, pushed the cord retractor button and was on my way to freedom."
And that's my courageous story.
"Your Honor, the prosecution moves that Principal Skinner's testimony be stricken from the record."
Denied. Case dismissed.
"Your Honor, do I still get paid?"
Hey Bart! I hope there are no hard feelings.
Get bent.
"I deserved that. Look, I know we let you down, but me and the boys, we still think you've got a big future in racketeering and extortion."
"Sorry Fat Tony. I used to think your gang was cool, but now I learned that crime doesn't pay."
"Blood on the Blackboard: The Bart Simpson Story. Starring Richard Chamberlain as Principal Skinner, Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony, Jane Seymour as the woman he loved, and TV's Doogie Howser, Neil Patrick Harris as Bart Simpson."
I'm scared. Let's get outta here.
"Where do you want it, Skinner?"
Not smart.
"Hey, when do we get the check for this?"
"Well, they said they changed it just enough so they don't have to pay us."
You know who the real crooks are? Those sleazy Hollywood Producers.
"Here's good news. According to this eye-catching article, SAT scores are declining at a slower rate."
"Dad, I think this paper is a flimsy hodgepodge of pie graphs, factoids and Larry King."
"Hey, this is the only paper in America that's not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine."
"""To me bestest bud  Happy Birthday, Bart."""
that's so sweet. May I see the card?
Hey there ten-year old. I couldn't afford to get you a new drum...
...so how about a nice pair of bongos? Ewww.
"C'mon, open it open it open it."
"Uh, maybe a little later, Bart."
Aw  just cuz your mom didn't let you have a party doesn't mean you can't get a present.
"We had a lovely time on Saturday, Milhouse."
I liked the balloons.
I liked the party hats.
What are you girls talkin' about?
Twins. Open your present.
"They're official Krusty the Clown walkie-talkies. I'll keep one and you keep one. Now whenever you want to talk to me, just call me on the phone and tell me to turn on my walkie-talkie."
"I'd like to express my appreciation for Saturday. Jelly bean baskets, personalized noisemakers -- those little touches are what made it enduring."
What's he talkin' about?
"Uh... hey, look at that dog. Isn't that somethin'?"
"Wow, brown!"
"Whoa, Springfield Elementary, last stop. Oh, and by the way, I'd like to say thanks, and 'applause, applause' to 'birthday boy' Milhouse for his totally bitchin' party on Saturday."
"And uh,  I think I left my pants on your roof."
You did have a party. You didn't invite me. And I thought we were best friends.
"Sorry, Bart."
Bye little dudes. Don't learn anything I wouldn't learn.
"Ah, Monday morning. Time to pay for your two days of debauchery, you hung-over drones."
"T.G.I.M., Sir."
"Yeah. so, what did you do this weekend, Smithers?"
"Well, I caught up on my laundry. And wrote a letter to mother. Oh, here's the kicker, I took Hercules out to be clipped."
Who the devil is Hercules?
"He's my Yorkshire terrier, sir. He's kind of tiny, so... you know, it's a joke. Here's a picture of Herkie."
"Well, Smithers, don't you know how to paint the town red."
May I ask how you spent your weekend?
"Well, a bit overly familiar, but I'll allow it. I took in a movie. An appalling little piece of filth. Its leading lady was a blonde harlot who spent half the film strolling around naked as a jaybird."
"Just give the great unwashed a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending, and they'll 'oink' for more every time."
What a movie. And that blonde cutie. Does she have assets.
Sounds like my kind of flick.
And how.
Otto! Welcome!
"Apu! Hey, got a ba-ad case of the munchies, man. Time for a Heat-lamp Dog."
"Oh, Otto. Otto, did you know there's a small child inside your bus?"
"Ooo, good thing you warned me. I was on my way to Mexico."
"Call me old-fashioned, but movies were sexier when the actors kept their clothes on. Vilma Banky could do more for me with one raised eyebrow than an entire..."
Warning. Problem in sector 7-G.
"7-G? Good God, who's the safety inspector there?"
eh? Good man? Intelligent?
"Actually sir, he was hired under ""Project Bootstrap."""
"Thank you, President Ford."
Huh? Noise. Bad noise!
Five minutes before critical mass.
"Critical wha...? Okay, okay, don't panic. Whosever problem this is, I'm sure they know how to handle it."
Huh? AHHH!! It's my problem! We're doomed!!!
Sector 7-G is now being isolated.
"My best friend shafted me. I'll never get over this, Otto-man."
"Aw, sure you will. You know, once my old lady ran off and married my brother. Well, it hurt, but here it is a month later and I'm sleeping on their couch."
"Margarita, I want you."
"Mr. Devereaux, I can't work under these conditions."
Have it your way baby. You're fired.
"Oh, Avery."
"Call me Mr. Devereaux, will you."
We interrupt Search for the Sun for this special news bulletin...
Meltdown crisis: The first couple of minutes.
K-B-B-L. Talk radio.
"Forget the hair, just give me the blush. Oh, we're on."
This station has just learned that a serious crisis is in progress at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.
Oh my Lord!
On the line with us now is plant owner C. Montgomery Burns. Mr. Burns?
"Oh hello, Kent. Right now, skilled nuclear energy technicians are calmly correcting a minor, piffling malfunction."
"But, I can assure you and the public that there is absolutely no danger whatsoever --"
-- things couldn't be more ship-shape.
"Sir, where's my radiation suit?"
How the hell should I know?
"Uh, Mr. Burns, people are calling this a meltdown."
"Oh, meltdown is one of those annoying buzzwords. I prefer to call it an unrequested fission surplus."
"Homie, please be all right."
"Gotta think! Gotta think! Okay, somewhere there's a thingee that tells you how to work this stuff. The um... the, uh... the manual! The manual! RIGHT."
Who'd have thought a nuclear reactor would be so complicated!
Ninety seconds to core meltdown.
"Sir, there may never be another time to say... I love you, sir."
"Oh, hot dog. Thank you for making my last few moments on earth socially awkward."
Looks like this is the end.
That's all right. I couldn't have led a richer life.
After the meltdown we can expect roving bands of thieves to tie up traffic for ours.
I don't like this program.
Change the channel.
Wheel of Fortune!
"I don't understand anything! When they look up stupid in the dictionary, there'll be a picture of me!"
"Dear Lord, if you spare this town from becoming a smoking hole in the ground, I'll try to be a better Christian. I don't know what I can do... Ummm, oooh, the next time there's a canned food drive I'll give the poor something they'd actually like instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix."
One minute to core meltdown.
Shut up!
it's all up to you. It's showtime!
"Okay, okay, think back to your training..."
"Now  this may very well save your life one day. This, Homer..."
"Please pay attention. This button here controls the emergency override circuit. In the event of a meltdown, push this button and only this button."
"Ooh, a side."
Do you see which button I'm pushing?
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, push the button, got it."
"This is all your fault! Okay, gotta pick a button. Pick a button. Pick a button. Uh, one potato, two potato, three potato, four... No, wait! Bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish, how many pieces do you wish? No, no!"
Thirty seconds to core meltdown.
"Oh, Smithers, I guess there's nothing left but to kiss my sorry butt good-bye!"
"May I, sir?"
"These unfortunate people here will be instantly killed. This circle, which I am sad to say we are in, will experience a slower, considerably more painful death."
Good Lord.
They called me old-fashioned for teaching the duck and cover. But who's laughing now?
Fifteen seconds to core meltdown.
"Eenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go... Eenie meenie minee... Moe."
All systems returning to normal. Danger in 7-G neutralized. Have a nice day.
Will I ever see you again?
"Sure, baby. Next meltdown."
"I'd like to solve the puzzle: ""Three loins in the fountain."""
"Yes, we've isolated the problem and wouldn't you know? False alarm. It seems a single wayward crow flew into our warning system."
"Very good. Well sir, your point about nuclear hysteria is well taken. This reporter promises to be more trusting and less vigilant in the future."
"Excellent. Well, ""ta"". Hmmm, Smithers, I can still sell 'em snake oil. Now bring me a wine spritzer -- and don't be stingy with the vino."
"So, Smithers, it seems you've underestimated one Homer Simpson... our next Employee-of-the-Month."
a little salt?
my mom won't let me be your friend anymore. That's why you couldn't come to the party.
What's she got against me?
She says you're a bad influence.
"Bad influence my ass! How many times have I told you, never listen to your mother!"
But  she threatened to cut off my allowance.
"Whatever she's paying you, I'll double it."
"I'm really sorry, Bart."
"Sir, about Employee-of-the-Month... I-I-if you'll recall, I'm the one who put a five percent ceiling on the Keogh Plan, which saved this company --"
"Smithers, you bean counter, give it up! Simpson's my man!"
"Hey, way to save our lives."
"Yeah, we owe you one."
"Hey, you know boys, a nuclear reactor's a lot like a woman. You just have to read the manual and press the right button."
Simpson -- Monty Burns. Come with me.
"Now, now. That will do.  for your bravery and skill, we award you this ham, this plaque, this discount coupon book, and my own personal thumbs up!"
"And to insure your immortality, your heroic visage will be added to our Wall of Fame... Oh, and uh, what's this? A congratulatory phone call from Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson."
Magic Johnson! Y'ello.
Is this really Homer Simpson?
Wow.  I just used our last time out to call and congratulate you on diverting that nuclear holocaust.
"Well, thank you."
"Magic, if you play on that ankle, you'll be in incredible pain."
I don't care.
"Uh, Magic. What if people think a guy's a hero but he was really just lucky?"
Don't worry. Sooner or later people like that are exposed as the frauds they are.
"Thanks, Magic."
you're not laughing. Too subtle?
"I'll think about it, Marge."
Nah. I'm just depressed. Milhouse's mom won't let me play with him any more.
did you go out and buy a twenty pound ham? And what's all this?
"""For heroic competence... for narrowly averting a melt-down and proving, without question, that nuclear power is completely safe... Employee-of-the-Month!"" Ohh, Homer!"
A role model in my very own home. How convenient.
"Look, I get enough admiration and respect at work. I don't need it here at home."
"How are you enjoying your ham, Homie?"
It tastes so bitter. It's like ashes in my mouth!
"Hmm, it's actually more of a honey glaze --"
Maybe you ate a clove.
"What's your problem, boy?"
I had a fight with Milhouse.
That four-eyes with the big nose? You don't need friends like that.
How Zen.
What? What is it? What are you doing?
Looking at you with quiet awe.
"Well, as long as it's quiet."
Milhouse to  Milhouse to Bart... Please don't hate me. Please?
"Oooh, right next to the boss. Eh, he'll never know who did it."
"Ah Simpson! There's someone I want you to meet. Aristotle Amadopolis, owner of the Shelbyville Nuclear Power facility."
Huh? Wha?...
It seems Ari's been having terrible worker problems at Shelbyville.
They've lost their zest for work. You must help them find their Eanae-eharatou-nah-duleve!
Their Eanae-eharatou-nah-dule-what?
We want you to give them a pep talk that turns them from a bunch of donut-eating goof-offs into a pack of Homer Simpsons.
"But I really can't tell them anything, sir."
"Oh cut the false modesty, it's getting tiresome. Besides, it's your duty. Employee of the Month isn't all ham and plaques."
"Well! Smithers, how kind of you to pay us a visit."
"Couldn't help it, sir. The parking here is terrible."
This man has no love for his power plant.
Begone from my sight.
That one's always been a problem.
One... two... three... Community chest.
Ah. I've won second prize in a beauty contest. Collect ten bucks.
Ha ha! You're losing.
don't feed your sister hotels!
"Don't worry mom, there's tons of these things."
I think that game is too old for her. Why don't you go play with Milhouse?
I don't wanna play with Milhouse.
You mean you still haven't made up with him?
"It's his mom. She says I'm a bad influence. C'mon Maggie, let's go throw rocks at that hornet's nest."
"Mrs. Van Houten, I'm Bart's mother -- we met in the emergency room when the boys drank paint."
"I remember. Please, come in."
"I'm sorry, but I think it would be better if Milhouse didn't see your son."
"Look, I know Bart can be a handful but I also know what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing... of course it makes him do bad things..."
"Well,  the other day, Milhouse told me my meatloaf sucks. He must have gotten that from your little boy, because they certainly don't say that word on TV!"
"Well, I can't defend everything he does. But let's face it, all Bart and Milhouse have is each other. They're too young for girls. And they're a popular target for bullies. And in the Christmas pageant, they're always sheep. Please, please, let them be friends!"
"So the next time somebody tells you county folk are good, honest people, you can spit in their faces for me!"
"I will, Mr. Gumbel. But if you'll excuse me, I'm profiling my dad for the school paper. I thought it would be neat to follow him around for a day to see what makes him tick."
"Oh, that's sweet. I used to follow my dad to a lot of bars too."
"Here you go. One beer, one chocolate milk."
"Uh, excuse me, I have the chocolate milk."
"What's the matter, Homer? The depressin' effects of alcohol usually don't kick in 'til closing time."
"He's just a little nervous. He has to give a speech tomorrow on ""How To Keep Cool In A Crisis."""
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
"Hey, I had to give a speech once. I was pretty nervous, so I used a little trick. I pictured everyone in their underwear. The judge, the jury, my lawyer, everybody."
Did it work?
All eggnog is terrible!
Those stockings are not hung by the chimney with care.
Why did I do this for money? Why did I do this for money?
And the Christmas special on your television is one of the worst.
"We now return to ""King Winter Feasts On His Children."""
"By the time Princess Summer comes to save you, you'll all be blood in my beard. Your own father's beard!"
How long to see Santa?
How would I know? I'm an accountant.
"I imagine for small business, huh?"
"God, I hate Christmas."
"Mr. Flanders, where's your store?"
"Well... I'm down to a kiosk, thanks to that place."
"Actually, half a kiosk. Sharing it with Nasreen here."
No cream is finer than mall kiosk cream. J Lo use it!
It is no wonder you are not married. Flip me back.
"If I have to give presents, I'll give presents with a purpose. One for Maggie... check."
All that's left is Bart.
"No, no, no, no, no, no... ah, perfect!"
...ALL FROM SATAN'S POWER AS WE WERE GONE ASTRAY...
O-O TIDINGS OF COM-OMFORT AND JOY!
"IN BETHLEHEM, IN ISRAEL / THIS BLESSED BABE WAS BORN!"
"Enough! Stop! Christmas carols only have one verse! Well they may have more, but the second verse is where they get all weird and religiousy."
"More wassail, please."
And don't skimp on the aromatic bitters!
"For your information, Gloria, my ""wassail"" is just Gatorade I put in the microwave!"
I drank that under the mistletoe!
"It's not mistletoe, just cherries and lettuce!"
I thought when I ate it it wasn't poisonous.
I've opened up my house to you. And all you do is fill this joyous season with petty complaints.
Not now. Take out that pillow and put it in room three.
The pillow acted as a girdle.
Any more questions?
"Ah yes, will the pudding be figgy?"
The pudding will be Jell-O.
Quite so.
I'm going to sulk in my room.
The only thing good about this place is the piano player.
An Angelica Button wizard robe... with wand pocket!
And wand.
Professor Digglesby's wand! Now I have every wizarding stick from the Spells and Potions Department of Wagglepoofs Academy!
Don't make me learn about it.
"I know this Christmas has been a little rocky even for the Simpsons. But I think these gifts born of thought and love will restore the balance of prajna and samsara, I mean holly and jolly."
"Now dad, I'd like to give you your present."
You got me weed?
"Even better! They're bags of seeds, so that you can plant a garden and watch it grow."
"That's great, sweetie. After all that time and hard work, I'll have... radishes?! It's the most hated part of salad, which is the most hated part of dinner! Radishes. Nothing but radishes."
What? I'm saving them from the struggle of life.
"Well, at least you're eating vegetables."
Okay  open your present. It's the one I'm most excited about.
Plastic bubbling vomit... plastic bubbling vomit...
"What?! Lis, you're smart. Why would you give me a book? 'Cause it's easy to wrap?"
Nothing is easy to wrap. I have trouble with scissors!
the brochure promised us a happy Christmas.
My uncle died in your bed. Merry Christmas.
What? N.C. Wyeth! These are book illustrations!
"Stop it, stop it! Why in the world would you burn a book?"
"Actually, the idea to do this came from a book."
Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury?
"What? No, I got it from this."
How could you burn the present I gave you?
Because it's my present! Did you give it to me because you thought I'd like it or because you wanted to feel better about yourself?
Children... perhaps it's time that I explain the true meaning of Christmas.
"Shut up, Flanders!"
Now did you check the room to make sure you haven't left anything?
All set.
"Need directions, or a bottle of water?"
"No thanks, we're fine."
Thank you sir!
"Oh right, we're still doing that."
"Come on, I'll drive you to the airport."
"Where are my keys? Oh, right here."
you were right.
"If you smell your farts in a dream, you die?"
"No, about Christmas. So I went out this morning and I got you this."
"It's a tablet with books on it, but also apps, like ""Worms With Friends."""
Wow. But how'd you afford it?
I sold the gift you gave me.
Get the twist?
"You're saying it's from Maggie, but actually it's from you. Thanks, Lis."
Now why don't you donate that to whatever hopeless cause you want.
"Thanks, Bart. This'll make a lot of arctic loons very happy."
"Listen, I just wanted to say I'm sorry I overreacted. Thank you all for coming."
"Well, we have something to say to you, Marge."
WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS / WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS...
WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS / AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR!
GOOD TIDINGS WE BRING--
No second verses! They creep me out.
"Okay, we'll sing a different one."
GOOD KING WENCESLAS LOOKED OUT / ON THE FEAST OF STEPHEN.
That one creeps me out from the beginning.
WHEN THE SNOW LAY ROUND ABOUT / DEEP AND CRISP AND EVEN / BRIGHTLY SHONE THE MOON THAT NIGHT / THOUGH THE FROST WAS CRUEL...
"Oh, the happy sound of a blender."
"Oh, boy. Monday morning chit chat at the water cooler. The only reason to have done stuff over the weekend."
...the only part of the movie I didn't get is: now Radioactive Man gets his powers from his suit?
"The suit is slowly killing him, but if he doesn't wear it, he'll die."
"Wait, you guys saw the new Radioactive Man sequel?"
"Uh, it's not a sequel, it's a reboot."
"Actually, this one undoes the stuff from the last one, so it's a de-boot."
Stop talking! I haven't seen it yet!
Radioactive Man Re-Rises came out three days ago. It is fair game.
"Yeah, if you haven't seen it, then you gotta leave the water cooler."
But what if I want some cooled water?
You should have thought of that when you were not seeing the movie.
It was so awesome when Radioactive Man had to erase his own memory.
"Yeah, so he wouldn't be tortured by his past, when he was born in the future."
"They're talking about the movie! Hurry up, you idiot! No, no, don't stop! I'm sorry I got mad. I'll do that thing you like."
I got Radioactive Man's new villain -- the Collider.
I turn out to be a good guy.
"I die, but come back to life after the credits."
"Sometimes we feel there's nowhere left to turn, much like Radioactive Man, when he had to kill his own antimatter twin"
AMAZING GRACE / HOW LOUD I SING / TO DROWN THE SPOILERS OUT... shut up. Shut up. Shut up!
"...with a blast of time particles from the Chrono-cube, and in doing so, mortally wounding his girlfriend, who was pregnant with his own grandfather."
"Okay, I've gotta go see the Radioactive Man movie before it gets totally ruined for me."
"Ooo, date night! I'll go change my bra!"
"I wanna see ""Radioactive Man Re-Rises!"""
"If Bart's going, I'm going!"
"If you all go, then I have to pay for a babysitter!"
We'll call that nice girl who's getting her Masters in Child Development.
Emily-Beth? We can't afford Emily-Beth! She brings her own puppets!
"Bye bye, Maggie!"
"Bye bye, money!"
"Two adults, two kids, and one senior with the mind of a baby so he should be free."
"For the 3-D show, that'll be seventy-two dollars."
"More snip, less lip."
Homer looks upset at the high ticket prices.
"Or, for ten dollars more you can see it in IMAX Hobbit Frame Rate Virtual Reality Vision."
"All right, movie, you better be worth it."
The motorcycle dudes are chicks!
I wonder what else is chicks?
Don't ask. Do smell.
"Also available in ""Arctic Slut,"" ""Morning After Melon,"" and ""Elon Musk."""
"Hey... they tricked us! That's a commercial! If I wanted to pay for commercials I can't skip, I'd sign up for Hulu Plus!"
You're shushing me! This guy's on his cell phone! She's texting! He's sexting! And that guy brought a baby to a nine o'clock movie!
"That's negative, man."
"What happened to the movies? First they got worse than TV, and now this!"
"Chins up, Homer. You don't need a theater to watch the movie. You just have to illegally download it."
Illegally download it? Is that legal?
Who knows? But it sure is easy. I'll walk you through it. All you have to do is--
"The FOX network forbids the broadcast of step-by-step instructions for illegally downloading copyrighted intellectual property. In the meantime, please enjoy this footage from Nascar's 2011 Martinsville Cup."
"Wow, that was easy! All I had to do was click on--"
And play!
"Bless you, boy. That was the greatest thing I've seen on a computer that I can talk about with you in the room. How did you know how to do that?"
I'm under thirty.
"Guys, guys, I saw the Radioactive Man movie! Here's my ten favorite scenes from worst to best -- number ten: when what's his name did that stuff with those dudes. Number nine--"
COPYRIGHT LAW / COPYRIGHT LAW
"Uh,  that movie's been talked out. We're discussing the new James Bond flick."
I like that James Bond is ugly now.
I like that he doesn't have any gadgets.
"I like that he's not good at shooting, doesn't say funny quips, or do any James Bond stuff."
Shut up shut up shut up!
go to the theater and see the movie.
Theaters? All I need to see this movie is a laptop and a website based in a country that's really just an offshore oil platform. Care to join me?
That was so much better than the cinema. It mixes the wonder of movie-going with the rush of stealing.
"All we want is brand new, big budget entertainment in our homes for nothin'! Why doesn't Hollywood get that?"
"Gentlemen, I am inspired to create a theater for the people -- an experience free of all the nuisances and gouging of modern day movie-going!"
"Yeah, no more jerks talking on their cell phones!"
No more jerks telling me not to talk on my cell phone!
And best of all... we'll never have to sit through another annoying commercial again!
"Welcome to ""Cinema Pirate-diso."" Tonight's movie is ""Life is Funny,"" directed by Judd Apatow. It's based on his life, starring his family, and adlibbed by his friends. So for the next three and a half hours, enjoy!"
Did you just pass gas while we were making love?
You're the one who hired the Korean taco truck for our private school fundraiser!
"I live it, he writes it."
"Well, what'd you think?"
"We may be going to hell for seeing ""side bosom,"" but this backyard is a little slice of Heaven, all thanks to Homer Simpson!"
This is fun! And it was so nice of the movie company to let you show their film.
"Let me? Uh, sweetheart, I downloaded it off the internet... illegally."
An illegal download? But Hollywood says stealing from Hollywood is wrong.
Why should a regular guy like me have to spend fifteen bucks a ticket so studios can pay huge salaries to the Air Buds and Ray Liottas of the world?
"When I watched that pirated movie, I was stealing with my eyes. So I'm repaying the good people in Hollywood for the ticket I should have bought."
Now this money will end up in the hands of the talented people who make magic happen on the silver screen.
"Karen, get me the FBI! Karen!"
You people joined this squad for one reason -- to fight movie pirates.
I wanted to catch serial killers.
I wanted to get serial killers.
"From now on, you will lay down your lives to protect America's chick flicks, buddy comedies, and steady stream of animated misfires."
"Sir, you have to see this."

"Men, set your guns on ""kill."" We're going after Homer Simpson."
"I now present, direct from the computer of an angry editor at a special effects house, ""Cosmic Wars Episode Seven""."

"Ow, ow, ow! I'm-I'm not wearing an undershirt and my badge is poking into my skin!"
What's going on here? Is there a fondler in the neighborhood?
I'm here to arrest and hopefully stage the prison suicide of the mastermind of this operation -- Homer Simpson!
"Ooo, mastermind."

"We got our man, thanks to a tip from a heroic American snitch."

"Baby, promise me you'll find out who turned me in!"
It's probably someone I would never suspect! Never suspect!
Your moans of sympathy are all I have!
Whoever did this will be haunted by unbearable guilt forever!
What are you guys in for?
Bank robbery.
Drug trafficking. What about you?
Movie piracy.
People in show business work hard to make those movies!
My media stocks under-performed because of people like you!
My brother lost his job as a grip on a movie set because of piracy. He had to sell his jet ski. A grip without a jet ski ain't no grip at all!

It's almost like having Dad here. Only with less growling when I go near his food.
I just want to know who dropped the dime on Dad. Lousy rat.
Maybe the person that turned your father in thought they were doing the right thing.
Homer just pirated a movie. It's not the worst thing Dad ever did. It's not even the worst kind of pirate Dad's ever been.
"tell your brother that stealing is wrong, no matter what."
I don't know. It wasn't like Dad was stealing for himself. He created this wonderful experience for the whole town. I just can't imagine anyone turning him in.
Dad! Dad! You're back! You're back!
Homer! What are you doing out of prison? You have to go back and give yourself up.
"I can't go back to jail! There's no shampoo, just soap!"
"Wait, I know one place in Springfield that doesn't care about internet piracy laws."
Thanks for taking us in. Our family always appreciates asylum.
This consulate is like being on Swedish soil. You're as safe here as you would be in the Skatteskrapan.
Your country doesn't think illegally downloaded movies is wrong.
The people of Sweden believe all movies should be shared freely.
How is that not stealing?
Bah! Your Hollywood studios are the real thieves -- claiming all their hit movies have lost money. I spit on their bookkeeping!
"Yeah, and why don't they make a sequel to ""Taken"" where the ""Hangover"" guys get taken and the only ones that can rescue them is ""Fast and Furious."""
"Oh man, I would love to pirate that."
As would the proud people of Sweden.
They've found us!
There's only one surefire way to get fugitives out of a foreign building: blasting death metal.
RESPECTIN' THE LAW / RESPECTIN' THE LAW / COPYRIGHT LAW / COPYRIGHT LAW
Swedes love death metal. It reminds us of death.
Damn those peace prize-giving fish-smokers!
I'm so tired of being trapped in this embassy.
"Consulates are regional offices, which serve the embassy in the capital."
Thank you so much for sticking with me through all this. You're the greatest wife in the world.
It was me! I was the one who told the FBI.
You? How could you? You're my own flesh and blood!
I was just trying to do the right thing! Who would have thought the authorities would use a confession against me?
"Have you forgotten what you promised at our wedding -- to love and cherish, to aid and abet?"
I never wanted to say funny vows!
Well you did. And they got laughs. Solid laughs.
"I didn't mean for this to happen, but... you were stealing."
All I ever had was you looking out for me. I've got nothin' now.
All rise in the matter of The People Versus Homer Simpson.
All rise in the matter of the People versus Homer Simpson!
"The people call Hollywood ultra-producer, Judd Apatow."
"Homer Simpson is an enemy of art. Art created by writers, directors, and the guy who uses a computer to erase or enhance nipples."
"And not just the people who dream for a living, but the people who depend on us. The spin class instructors, the personal rabbis, Seth Rogen."
"It's true, I need him."
"I saw a bootleg DVD of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" for sale at a carwash... they left off my director's commentary! It didn't even have a blooper reel!"
So... everyone's a pirate?
"Homer  you have been found guilty of illegal reproduction and distribution of copyrighted material. Before sentencing, do you have anything to say for yourself?"
"tell them your side of the story. I know I hurt you, but please trust me now. It'll work."
"You know what, Judge Apatow... I do have something to say. These movie people may say I'm a pirate. But I'm just a man. A man who loved Hollywood too much. So I made my own rules, and fought the big guys who tried to destroy my way of life."
He doesn't sound like a villain.
He sounds like a classic underdog.
He's the unlikeliest of heroes!
But where's the love story?
At first my wife didn't believe in me. Maybe we forgot why we fell in love in the first place.
"But when times seemed darkest, one minute ago, she was there, and gave me the strength and courage to fight for what I believe in."
He's a downloading David versus a greedy Goliath!
An Erin Brockovich -- but with more cleavage!
"Two, three, good lord."
He's hitting all four quadrants!
"One family, against all odds, took on the system... and lost."
Mr.  I'd like to buy the rights to make a movie based on your true story.
I'm attached as executive producer! Attached! Attached!
One movie? We envision a trilogy.
Will Smith's family wants to play your family.
I'd be Jaden!
"On behalf of Hollywood, we are dropping all charges."
These people hate my dad. How can they want to make a movie about him?
"Hollywood may be run by big corporations trying to squash people, but they make movies about people standing up to big corporations trying to squash them... and winning."
And the worst one of all is--
I'll sign with whoever can convince Channing Tatum to gain the most weight to play me.
What the hell is all this?!
We're so excited about your movie that we're having a special screening.
But the movie isn't in theaters till next week.
"Yeah, we ripped a version off Bootleg Bay just like you taught us."
"It's still got time code on it, but otherwise, it's a clean copy."
You're pirating my movie?
The hell you are! Piracy is stealing! You're taking money out of my family's mouths.
"But the movie is, it's about you pirating movies."
"Oh that's Hollywood fantasy. We live in the real world, where I have something called ""prof-it par-ti-ci-pa-tion""."
Now all of you go see my movie in the theater the day it opens! No bargain matinees!
And tell your friends it was great! Buy the stuff they advertise in the commercials before it.
Homer in the movie wears Ask Body Spray and so should you. Don't ask! Do smell!
"Homie, do you really think you should be--"
Up bup bup bup bup! What have we learned about not blindly supporting our husband?
Ask Body Spray!
"But then when times seemed darkest, she was there, and gave me the strength and courage to fight for what I believe in."
"On behalf of Hollywood, we're dropping all charges."
"So what do you think, Lis? Who are the good guys here, the media companies or the internet freedom guys?"
"Well, both groups claim their intentions are noble, but at the end of the day, they're both trying to steal as much money as they can."
"High above Zenith City, Radioactive Man keeps a lonely vigil."
All seems quiet. Maybe I'll fly to China and get some takeout.
"A Sky Tweet from Commissioner Sweeney! This looks like a job for ""at-Radioactiveman-underscore-oh-one""!"
Leaping leptons! It's the Fossil Fuel Four! Old King Coal...
Petroleus Rex...
"French femme fatale, Charcoal Briquette..."
"And the enemy of drinking water everywhere, The Fracker..."
"Stop attacking the nuclear plant, this country's safest energy source!"
Studies show I'm America's best hope for energy independence!
Those studies were industry-financed!
Holy hadrons! I need backup!
Calling Citizen Solar and his sidekick Wind Lad!
I believe you will find zem... lacking in energy.
It's too cloudy.
People don't like the noise I make!
Petroleus Rex! Please remember when you used to be environmental scientist Rex Bernstein!
I have become my dessstiny!
"I'll crush you like a gnat, King Coal!"
Half-life... quarter-life... eighth-life... gone.
They killed off Radioactive Man?! I did not see that coming. Die carumba.
They'll just reboot Radioactive Man in an overpriced new origin issue and get clueless fanboys like you to line up at midnight to buy them.
Clueless fanboys in costume!
Wow! Midnight! I won't know which day to write in my diary.
Would you take me to buy a comic book Tuesday at midnight?
"And miss the back half of Jimmy Kimmel? That's when he experiments, boy."
You never watched an episode of Jimmy Kimmel in your life!
Yes I have! After the Oscars when he forces you!
"Quiet! Quiet! And attention, please, valued customers. You will each be allowed to enter the store and buy one copy. Swallow your gum now."
Mr. Book Guy? Can I go first? I was once cast to play Fallout Boy in a movie.
Tell it to Harlan Ellison.
I think you over-privileged kids with your electronic tablets and your talking phones wouldn't know a good piece of fiction if your iPod read it to your ass!
I wish someone would've come from the future and warned me not to talk to you.
That's my idea. You're stealing my idea.
"C.B.G., what's the haps, my man?"
"Well, well, well, if it isn't Milo, the owner of my main competitor, Coolsville - or should I say, Foolsville."
"That is some tasty cashish, my friend."
Indeed. And how did you spend your evening?
"Let's see... I wrote a ""Lost"" fan fiction finale that also answers all the questions from ""Twin Peaks..."" re-ranked all the ""Dr. Who""s by puffiness of the hair... oh, and I also got married to my actual, non-imaginary, comic-tolerating girlfriend, Strawberry!"
Now when Milo talks to himself it won't seem crazy.
"So, Milo talks to himself. We will treasure that information. Yes we will."
"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna share this primo origin ish with my bride. Even the mintiest comic is just acidifying pulp if you have no one to read it with, right?"
Nerds don't get girls!
"These days they do, man. Comicon is now eight percent women."
Wrong! Wrong! Wr-- or... is he?
"C'mon, buddy. I gotta get home and climb into bed with my loving wife."
"Oh right, you have a loving wife?"
Marge and I get along perfect. We're like George Burns and John Denver.
"Man, carrying these kids is hard on my back."
And now to Moe's.
"Look at him, he's got family... friends... what do I have? ""Jimmy Olsen versus Matter-Eater Lad."" Hm, better than I remembered actually. No! No, it isn't! It's horrible! The only thing that could make this moment more clichÃƒÂ©d is if I started to sing about my feelings... and here I go."
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HAPPY TO CALL MYSELF SINGLE / NO MARY JANE OR LOIS LANE WITH WHOM I'D COMINGLE...
YOU COULD SAY THAT I WAS / AN UNSTACKABLE PRINGLE.

"GUESS I'VE ALWAYS BEEN LONELY, BUT I'VE NEVER REVEALED IT. / DROPPED MY HEART INTO MYLAR, AND THEN VACUUM SEALED IT."
Stan Lee! Or... is it my imagination?
I'm your imagination. The real Stan Lee's over there.
"But listen: as comic book guys go, you're trim, friendly and quite a catch."
But now your opportunity is knocking.
Don't let it slip by.
Can you help me?
I can only watch. I cannot interfere.
"New Radioactive Man number one, please."
"Come on, Nudnick. Ask her out."
You're interfering!
"Hey, I'm ninety years old. I can do what I want."
"Um, er, stammer, eh... can I sign you up for our frequent buyer's club -- ""The Just Us League?"""
You would be Member Number zero zero three. I am the first two.
Sure. I am Kumiko Nakamura from Osaka.
I'm visiting America's saddest cities as research for my autobiographical manga.
"Volume six: ""Springfield: Land of Angry Tears""!"
That's you. The man with sparkling eyes and zigzag beard.
You've seen me before?
"Yes, through window. But you don't see me. You're either looking down in disgust or up in disdain. I think you have great soul."
Would you permit me to go in the back and do a brief inventory?
She tolerates me!
It is the perfect time.
Bart! Your comic vendor's here!
"Actually, it is you that I am here to see. I, um, I need your help... in getting ready for a date. The closest thing I have to a father is the Obi-Wan doll in my store. And he comes from a race of celibate knights, so..."
I will help you. As long as our bellies never touch again like they are right now.
But why pick me?
Because you're the only fat man in real life who ever got a hot woman.
"Well, come in! I'll explain how it all works. Okay, it helps if she's got a mother she's trying to get back at."
No woman will be able to resist you dressed like this.
"Now remember, don't be the way you normally are, and sustain that for the rest of your life."
"Kumiko, meet my dear friends, Homer and Marge Simpson. In my country it is a tradition to bring a much older couple on a first date. It is not in any way weird or sad."
Does anyone tell you that you look like the man on a box of Mr. Sparkle?
Aka ni taishte burei da! Yogore o yaburu!
"In Japan, drinking your detergent is a popular method of suicide!"
Honki da yo?!
"Kumiko, for you we chose the coolest restaurant in town."
But the walls are covered with garbage.
"Not garbage, Americana."
Here's some more Americana that bubbled up in the swamp.
"Here you go! Your all-American, fifty-state potato skin sampler!"
"Okay, Wisconsin, cheddar. Maryland, blue crab..."
They're neither in alphabetical nor geographical order! What madness is this?!
"Please, sir, ask your questions after all fifty ""tates""!"
I cannot hide the snide inside!
"I don't mind. If you think it's stupid, say it's stupid."
"In Japan, no one ever says what they think. We know our game shows are degrading and our baseball fences are too close. But no one says anything."
"Attention restaurateurs! You should've spent less on the kitsch and more on the kitchen! With this bowl of Chuck's Cherokee Salsa, I baptize you mediocre at best!"
American nerd snark is the finest in the world. Let's go walking and mocking in the rain.
I'm in love! And yet still a little bitter. It's surprising.
"Father, why-sa you-sa forsake-a me-sa?"
Enough nonsense! I came here for my daughter!
you have nurtured our love like Steven Spielberg nurtured the careers of Zemeckis and Gale...
"So we want you to know I have decided to move in, to the basement under his store."
"At last we'll be in the same bed, just like Batman and Robin."
I want you to take Kumiko and Comic Book Guy a housewarming present... and maybe check in on them?
"We've talked about this, Marge. The hammock is a chore-free zone."
Apparently including tying the knots on the hammock.
And getting the termites out of the trees.
Not a word.
"Excuse me, sir, I am looking for my daughter. I thought this was her residence, but all I see is a store full of non-pornographic manga."
"You're Kumiko's father? Welcome, sensei!"
"I am not Kung Fu instructor. I am humble salaryman who could kick your ass. Say, has anyone told you you look like--"
"I know, Mr. Sparkle."
"I was going to say, like you're going to have a stroke."
I get that a lot too.
"Now please, where is my daughter?"
"Okay, she moved in with her boyfriend. Well, he's not a boy. He's immature, but fat and old."
"So, an obese nerd has stolen my daughter to live in his basement?!"
I didn't tell you about the basement.
It was an obvious guess!
"Daughter, you are coming back to Japan! There are eighty-seven old people who need you to take care of them."
No! Please! Please! I was becoming cuddly! I deleted rants from my blog!
You can retrieve rants if you did not empty your trash. Goodbye!
"Now I know I've got a heart, because it's breaking. Wizard of Oz reference! Did I do that? Urkel reference! Help me. Fly reference! I can't stop. I can't stop."
Homer  this was your doing. And I want you to fix it!
I have a bad feeling about this. Every-action-movie-ever-made reference!
we have much in common. We both love our daughters and discipline our sons.
"No, discipline would imply I'm trying to make him better... so, are you married?"
My dear Michiko has passed away but she is always with me.
You promised double suicide!
You hear what you want to hear!
Always with me. Another drink! Something stronger!
Snake rice wine.
Now that's disgusting. Wine made of rice?
Try some.
Why didn't I stop with the snake wine? Why did I drink the fish wine?
That was the aquarium!
You didn't see nothin'. Scram!
I am ruined by whimsy!
"The good thing is, soon I'll be a beautiful swan."
We'll explain it!
The rice wine has penetrated to the essence of your souls.
"Yeah, listen to my tail."
You're the tail!
"No, you're the tail!"
"Dad, Bart's feet are on my half of the shell!"
Why you slimy little...!?
"Hey, that actually feels good!"
"Oh yeah, more. A little bit more. Right there. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's the stuff!"
"I AM A GOLDEN BIRD / AND I LOVE THE COMIC NERD / OF THIS I WON'T BE CURED / PAPA SAN, PAPA SAN..."
The monster is me! Who'da thunk it?!
drinking that snake wine and going to White Castle afterwards really opened my eyes.
"Mister Nakamura, I have used my hitherto unmentioned chemical engineering degree to get a real job, at the Springfield Phosphate Works."
They're giant polluters but the C.E.O. is a woman. It's very vexing.
"Now, have I proven myself worthy of your daughter?"
You were worthy... the way you were.
I was? But I rented the store! I ebayed my stool!
Cancel the sale!
But then my seller rating will go down!
Stop being nerd!
"Yes, Papa-san."
"Geekly beloved, we're gathered here in the eyes of me, king of the cameo, Stan Lee, to celebrate the wedding of Comic Book Guy and Kumiko Nakamura. Does anyone wish to offer any thoughts on this blessed occasion?"
"Yes, I would like to say something. Since I met Kumiko, strangely, comic books no longer seem so important. I will also be selling greeting cards. Every day I will give one to Kumiko in commemoration of today with the salutation ""Best. Day. Ever."""
"Ghost wife, are you happy?"
Kind of!
How long am I gonna stay this way?
As long as we keep drinking this.
Give us your eggs.
I'm a boy!
We said eggs!
GLOWING RODS / GLOWING RODS / IT'S MAKING ME / WEAK AND DIZZY...
Rumor has it they're about to give out the company Christmas gifts.
I got an in. The V.P. of Personnel is doing my girlfriend.
"Look at you, Mr. Connected."
I hope it's better than last year's lousy gift.
"Yeah, what a rip."
Remember this gift?
The executive stress ball.
One more squeeze and you're fired!
Now-I-feel-more-stressed-than-ever! Gah!
Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!
You don't look so excellent to me.
Ho-ho humbug! Santa Claus approaches to judge and punish!
"Wow, a good gift for once!"
Oogle Goggles. Augmented Reality Glasses.
"You wear them like eyeglasses, but inside the lens, you see information about the people and places around you."
Finally I'm not a slave to my stupid human eyeballs!
Glasses! Call Lenny!
I'm getting a call! Answer call! Hello?
"Lenny! It's me, Homer!"
Huh. I always thought it was Simpsen.
Really? Don't you ever look up at the sky?
I always wondered what that was.
"Sir, I'm concerned about your sudden generosity. The doctor said to bring you in right away if you display kindness or warmth."
Don't worry. This Santa still has claws!
"As of now, each of those nuclear nitwits is wearing a video camera -- with a direct feed to me."
You're spying on them!
Smithers... how much did this company lose to office supply theft last year?
"Seven thousand, forty-three dollars."
"Yes, well, no more of that... thanks to this twenty-six million dollar surveillance system! Beware, rabbits... I spy with my transplanted eyes! Oh, and I forgot to show you the best feature!"
"Each of these buttons represent an employee. When I press it, he or she dies."
What's wrong with this thing?
"Now, remember kids, the school says you must have a valentine card for everyone in your class."
How does this mean anything when everyone's forced to do it?
What did I say about pointing out the meaninglessness of things?
Not to.
"Well, no way I'm giving a valentine to Nelson. He's a bully, and I do not love him."
Jesus says to love your enemies.
"That's because Jesus knows one day he gets to look his enemies in the eye and say: ""It was me who sent you to Hell."""
your school requires you to give everyone a Valentine card in an envelope with a fun sticker. Your teacher put out an email alert... with a video attachment.
"Welcome to Firstline. Tonight: Valentine's Day: Always A Massacre."" At this school, children may give valentines to whomever they choose. Danny is unpopular, due to rumors he sleeps in the raw with his ma and his pa."
"Human young are born with the ability to count valentines, and Danny realizes he's been snubbed."
"Past generations of children were used to rejection. But today's kids, raised in a climate of video games and instant messaging, are fragile weirdoes."
"On February fifteenth, two a.m., after checking the mailbox one last time, Danny nearly died from an overdose of little candy hearts."
"Many of history's monsters never received a valentine: Attila the Hun. Mao Tse Tung. And me, Will Lyman. This is Firstline."
"Fine, Nelson gets a valentine. An old one from the box."
"Perfect. Bad movie, bad pun, even bad paper stock."
I'm watching videos of idiots wearing these glasses and not paying attention to the world around them.
Look at these jerks.
"I don't understand what's so great about these state of the art, solar-powered, computo-glasses."
"I'll let you try them on, right after I decide if these videos are ""Funny Or Die"". Funny, funny, die, die, funny, funny but the guy died..."
"Now, a simple Sunday drive will reveal the hidden wonders of our hometown!"
"Springfield City Hall was built for the Spencer Tracy movie ""Meet Me At City Hall"". It was just a flat wall with nothing behind it for thirty years..."
Dad! Bart's on my side of the seat!
Da-ad! Lisa's my little sister!
The rearview mirror was invented in nineteen eleven for just this reason...
"Interesting. When was the term ""shut up"" invented?"
"As early as eighteen fifty-nine, ""shut up"" was used to shut up..."
"Homie, I think the kids are just hungry."
"Glasses, direct me to the nicest restaurant I can afford."
Accessing soup kitchens...
"That's it, I'm taking you off."
"I'm sorry, sir."
"Okay, let's see what we've got here."
"Squeeze here. Rotate there. Pause for sweet talk. Oh glasses, you're so wonderful."
Are you using your glasses for snuggling?!
Where's my money?
But the avatar looks just like you!
I'm afraid wives don't make passes at husbands in those glasses.
"Glasses, find me a great gift for my wife. Under five dollars."
"Glasses, take me two minutes back in time."
About the glasses...
"I'm really sorry, and..."
Here's your breakfast.
Only five pancakes? You're trying to kill me!
"Well, I'm not happy with you."
"Look, honey, I know these glasses are a radical new technology and should be worn in moderation. Isn't that right, glasses?"
Yes. Just like I told you.
"Anyway, I'm giving them up... ...to whoever dares take them."
"Aw, come on, Mom!"
For once I'm grabbing the goody.
So the rumors are true: Moms can want things.
"Nicely done, Lewis... A Transformer that transforms into a heart? I LOVE IT!"
This Hershey's Kiss is melted! Not good.
My Mom left it on the dashboard... my Mommm!
"I'll have yours now, Simpson."
In Ga'hoole we would break his frickin' knees.
"No. No valentine for you, Nelson."
I'll give a valentine to a loser. I'll give a valentine to a dork. I'll even give a valentine to a girl. But I won't give a valentine to a bully.
there's gonna be a heart in my hand. Either paper... or yours.
"That's strange. I'm hearing a voice, but I'm not seeing a user icon."
"Carl, it's me! I'm here! Really here!"
"Hey, Homer! A lot of information about you. Let me just page through it."
What! No one can live in a non-augmented reality! I need another pair of glasses!
"Charlie, your move in Muppet Chess."
Gonzo to Fozzie Seven.
That's Kermit mate!
Wocka wocka!
Why is it the recipe card you need is always the one Homer writes his cocktail ideas on?
Maybe these bleep-bloop glasses can help.
"Okay, Marge  entering the Matrix, for a brownie recipe."
Here are my top-rated recipes.
"Ooo... So many choices, Maggie."
"Um, Mr. Burns, sir? Can I get another pair of glasses? Maybe two pair. One for the beach house. Can I also get a beach house? Two beach houses..."
What the-- Burns gave us those glasses so he could spy on us!
This is a violation of our human rights.
"Okay, so let's see what we can see!"
"Solitaire, top hats on eBay, Angry Birds fan fiction...guy doing really easy crossword puzzle...Lenny doing Carl's clown makeup."
...someone's actually working...
Who's mommy's little girl? Genealogy dot org says you are. You are!
"Awww... Wait a minute... since Marge is wearing my glasses, I can see everything she sees. Uh-uh, I shouldn't watch this."
Such a good baby! You deserve some ice cream.
Wait a minute. Marge said we were out of ice cream.
What else is Marge hiding from me?
"Maggie, he's here!"
Is she having an affair?
Thanks for asking me to lunch.
Why isn't she having an affair?
"What about a valentine that says: ""Bully, For You?"""
"Hmm, interesting."
"Interesting means ""no."""
Interesting means no...  you're a genius!
I am? What did I say?
"Nothing. On TV, when a guy says something lame, another guy says he's a genius, and then he has an idea. I thought it might work for me."
"Well, you called me a genius. That means a lot."
I hate this stupid holiday! The only thing you can do is screw it up. That's it!  you're a genius!
"Well if you keep throwing the word around, it means nothing."
Who are you?!
"I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns. I won't disturb you again."
that's a compact-only space!
"Well, who knew you were such a rebel? Now, let's learn more about my wife's secret life. Secrets which can only be good."
Hi  Dr. Carlock is ready for you.
So  how have you been?
"Okay, I guess."
Marge is in therapy?
"I hate when I come here and the first word out of my mouth is Homer. But here we go. Again. Homer was converting our dollars to gyros... not the money, the sandwich..."
And has there been any improvement in Homer's drinking?
"Well, he's down to two beers in the shower..."
Pale ales. Please.
"Well, maybe if you just concentrate on one problem, like his temper."
Everything in the newspaper makes him mad.
Not Marmaduke! Never Marmaduke!
"Marmaduke was horrible today! Also, Marge is in therapy and she didn't even tell me!"
Whoa. She has crossed a line. How did you find out?
"Spied on her with a hidden camera. She thinks I'm selfish, she thinks I don't spend enough time with the kids..."
"What? That's crazy! Come on, you work your butt off in a radioactive hellhole, and what do you get? Not one lousy superpower!"
I guess the only choice is to come clean and tell her what I know... and how I know.
"Whoa-ho, bad idea! No, no. Chicks do not like finding out they're being spied on. I speak from looooooooooooooooooong experience. Now, you gotta make it seem like you found out by accident there. Ooh! Next week youse schedule an appointment with the therapist, after hers, and then you ""bump into"" Midge in the waitin' room, there."
"Moe, that's great. How do you get your ideas?"
Pretty much all my friends are divorced guys.
"Hello, Homie! Dinner's almost ready! Pork chops with my secret seasoning!"
"Yeah, you do like your secrets, don't you, Marge?"
"Don't lose your cool, Homer. The building block of a marriage is long silence. Hey, where'd she go?"
"Good, good, you held your tongue. Because... hey, where'd you go?"
Doesn't anybody want me to give 'em advice?
"Okay there, Fido. When you see that squirrel outside, at first, you play it cool, you understand?"
I fear you? This is what Valentine's Day means to you?
"This is what it means to everyone. How can you be forced to say ""I love you?"" People only give valentines because they're scared of what would happen if they didn't."
"Nelson, you frighten me so / The psycho-est bully I know / You're a sociopath / in need of a bath / I'm sure you'll wind up on Death Row."
"Mm, you can really smell the fear on this."
I rubbed it on Milhouse.
you just touched my heart's butt!
Why are you hugging yourself? Why are you hugging yourself?...
"If Nelson doesn't do something bully-ish in two seconds, I'm gonna wedgie him."
Nelson doesn't wear underwear.
Wow. Always one step ahead.
"Uh, I'm here to check in for the three o'clock."
"Please fill out these forms, Mr. Fakinami."
"That's ""Fake Name."""
I'll just call you Elias.
"That's ""Alias."" Du-uh."
"Same time next week, Marge?"
"Oh, absolutely. These sessions keep me on an even keel."
Dr. Carlock is like my Wednesday reset button.
Oh my God... Marge needs this. It lights her way through the dark path of marriage to me.
"Come on in, Mr. Fakinami."
No need. Everything's fine.
I'm sorry. But there are no cancellations within twenty-four hours.
"Well, as long as I'm paying for the time..."
"Ow! Where'd you learn to cut hair, idiot?"
"You know, you have some anger issues."
"Oh I forgot to tell you, Homie! I bumped into Helen Lovejoy today, and guess what?"
"I don't need to know, Marge. You deserve to have your secrets."
It's not a secret. It's a funny story.
"Okay, Marge. But first, well, I have something I need to tell you. Something I did you might be mad about, and rightly so."
"Oh, I bet my story's more interesting."
Woo-hoo! I tried! Okay.
"Okay, so Helen Lovejoy told me that she made her famous snicker doodle Bundt cake for the church sale, and she put in salt instead of sugar!"
Yeah. And?
That's it. That was the story.
Where's that cake now?
It got sold.
Who bought it?
Dr. Hibbert.
Excuse me. I have to make a call.
Don't take too long!
"Okay, Hibbert's in surgery, but they're having him paged."
"Wait, something's wrong. That's better."
"Hi, Ralph... um, I just wanted to tell you there was a tooth in the valentine you gave me."
Plant it and you'll grow a new Ralph!
"I don't need a new Ralph, I like the old one. Happy Valentine's Day!"
"Well, better get ready for St. Patrick's!"
"...And it's for all these reasons, and more, that the Kingdom of Moab is the least interesting in the Bible. Amen."
Amen! We're done!
Allow me to introduce our guest speaker...
"...from our ill-advised mission in Indonesia, the Rev. Kartawijaya."
"I know how you feel, young man!"
"The children in my village are just like you. One boy, named Sumadi, never comes to church."
"He is always tying the monkeys' tails together and yelling ""tiger is gone"" when in fact the tiger is there."
"Unfortunately, Sumadi is sick now."
What?! Sumadi has a problem?
"Sumadi... and others equally doe-eyed... need urgent medical treatment. After all, we are all just children of Allah. I mean, God. Sorry, recent convert."
Poor Sumadi. Born in such a terrible country.
"But, good news. To help him we will now have a second collection."
Wasn't our sympathetic nodding enough?
"Mom, can I have some money?"
"I'm sorry, honey. I'm all out. I spent all I had lighting that candle for Great Aunt Betty."
I hope that wasn't somebody's Aunt Betty or something.
Dad? Please? For Sumadi?
"Sorry son, I only have twenties. And if God needs money, why doesn't he just write another Bible? The first one sold pretty well."
Does anyone remember when it was considered rude to talk in church?
"Pipe down, Ned."
"All right, son... but you have to pay me back."
Life is good.
Do you have my money?
How could I?
"Right, right, too soon. Do you have my money?"
"Seriously, do you have my money?"
Where's... my... mon... ey?
"It's been a rough patch, man. Hope you got something to cheer me up."
"Well, there is one fun fact I've been saving for an emergency situation. Did you know there really was a Duncan Hines?"
"Where's my money? Do you have my money? Where is it? You know, if you had the money, I'm right here. Do you have the money?"
quit badgering the boy.
"Pressure's how you make your beloved diamonds, Marge."
I don't have any diamonds.
Quit pressuring me!
"Money, money. I need money!"
Would you eat anything for money?
I guess. Who are you?
"School play. ""Damn Yankees."""
Children of the playground! I will eat anything for money! Except money!
I'll give you a quarter if you eat my gum.
I'll give you another if you eat mine!
Here's some orthodontic wax!
And thome thinnamon!
St. John's Wort!
And here's something that'll make you forget about the other stuff.
"Ay carumba. So, what else ya got?"
"All right, Simpson. Twenty big ones says you're not messed-up enough to eat... this!"
No  no. Do it and you'll always be known as the kid who ate the dead frog.
Where's my money! Get my money! Money-money-money-money-money...
Easiest money I ever...
I like the lack of attention. Especially in here.
"Son, by rights I should be playing banjo at your funeral. That frog was filled to the gills with formaldehyde, a highly toxic poison."
"Here's your money, dad."
What? Did you owe me some money?
And  here's your bill for four thousand dollars.
"Where's my money? You got my money? Where's my money? Seriously, where's my money?"
Ew! It's the kid who ate the dead frog.
That's someone who eats plants.
I named the frog Herb!
Even you won't sit with me?
"if you sit here, I'll be the boy who sat next to the boy who ate the frog. And I'm already the boy who shared a comb with a boy who threw up on the boy who wet his pants at the winter carnival. P.S. I would've given you the money."
What's the matter? Frog in your throat?
You're the ones that paid me to eat it.
"All we hear is ribbit, ribbit!"
You said this was a simple bullying job!
"Diggs and Freedom, at your service. Diggs is short for Digby."
Thanks. I'm the kid that ate the frog.
"Oh, so you're the reason I had to dissect a Muppet in biology today."
"Thanks for the help, man."
"Oh, you're welcome. At least, from me. There's no way to say what the bird thinks, or even if he thinks, really."
Wait! Wait! Wait! Who the hell are you?
I transferred here a few months ago.
To this school? On purpose? Even after Springfield Montessori opened across the street?
That place is really in your face.
This school has a falconry club? No way.
I resuscitated it.
"I'm president, secretary-treasurer, and faculty adviser. That took a lot of fancy paperwork but it was worth it to be left alone."
Can I join?
"Hmm, I'll have to check with Freedom."
Habemus Papam! We have a poop! It's white! You're in!
Looks like the falconry club's back from the dead!
Can the Esperanto Society be far behind? I mean... Ã„Ë†u la Esperanto-Societo esti multe malantaÃ…Â­?
Two languages and somehow no one will talk to you.
Ã„Å“i estas vera. Mi tre soleca.
The first thing to learn about falcons is how beautiful they are in flight.
"Don't fret, he'll be back."
There's my Sky Gramma!
"Bart's usually first in line for Taco night, but now he's ""muy tarde."" Is it all right to say ""tarde?"""
"Hey, you've said it twice, Marge. You're in pretty deep."
Ten minute rule.
What? A rule's a rule.
He is just riding that thermal.
You were right about watching him fly.
"I thought you'd get it. Seat-backs and tray tables, Bart. We're coming in for a landing!"
Wow. You don't know how impressive that is to a boy whose dad can't even get the dog to sit.
Sit. Sit. Sit! Sit! SIT!!!
"I don't know what that is, but it's not sitting!"
Where could Bart be?
"Hey, I'm not flying anywhere with this broken wing."
I saw him heading across the field after school with a kid a little bit older and undoubtedly wiser.
"Oh, I know what that means. There comes a time when a boy sneaks his first beer. Finally! I was beginning to think that kid was a teetotaler."
Bart  at your service.
"More like ""at your six-pack,"" am I right? It's okay if you need to take a little nap."
Why would I want a nap?
Because you're so drunk you can barely keep it together!
I wasn't drinking. I was learning that nature isn't a complete waste of space.
That doesn't sound like you.
But it does sound like the kind of lie you'd make up after the first time you got blitzed.
"I met this kid. A little older, kind of strange. I don't think other people get him, but I just wanna hang out with him all the time."
It's even better than I thought... you've found your Moe Szyslak! In just a few short years you'll be getting your version of baked on your version of pot listening to your version of Journey.
What's he doing?
"Now when he lands, you'll feed him, so he has positive associations with you."
Don't worry. He's only bitten off one of my fingers.
Just goofing on you. This is the finger he bit off.
"If he starts to carry you off, slip out of the glove. Now tell him to fly."
"Fly! Fly! C'mon, man! Do the wing thing!"
I did it! He did it! We did it!
"Yes,  that is how you conjugate the verb ""to do."" Well done."
Hey! Bring back my bling!
Give that back! All I've got is a hole in my face!
Uncle Krusty's back!
Whoa! Did you teach him to do that?
I get it. It sucks. Really sucks.
Nobody could communicate that -- except maybe Gerard Manley Hopkins:
"""I caught this morning morning's minion, kingdom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding / Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding / High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing!"""
I've already eaten.
"Hey, you want to see something really cool?"
Is a falcon's training leash called a creance? Yes!
Say something so I'll know you're not hurt.
I'm really hurt.
"Bartholomew! Good to see you, old sport. Where's Freedom?"
"Well... my Dad said don't bring home anymore dogs, cats, turtles or snakes, but he never said anything about predatory birds."
"Okay. In your terms, points are like mice."
Don't interrupt! I just thought it would be nice if we shared an interest.
You Korean girls know what a soldier likes.
Fine! But the game is much more enjoyable if you understand it.
"Look, the Eagles and the Falcons. Tell me you're not interested in that."
I could fly too if I didn't have a wife and three kids!
"Hey, you've had a lot of visitors."
"No, I signed them myself. They're people I would've liked to come visit."
Listen... what happened in that tree?
"Um... you want the truth? Of course you do. You're like Diogenes, but with slingshot in place of lamp."
I wanted to fly.
"I know it sounds a little crazy now, but I suddenly thought maybe we can all fly, but somehow we've forgotten that we can."
"You don't still think that, do you?"
here's another doctor that would like a few words with this young man.
This hospital has another doctor?
So they're transferring him to another hospital.
"Well, I hope he gets out soon and takes his bird back. I don't care for how it circles the cat."
He's just riding the thermals from Dad's butt.
At least someone in this family is using them.
I never heard of this new hospital so I looked it up and printed it out.
Can I visit him tomorrow?
I don't know Bart. This is one of those... Arkham Asylum-type hospitals.
Diggs isn't cuckoo!
"Uh, listen, boy... maybe you should spend more time with your old best friend. You know, Dweebler."
Milhouse abandoned me.
"So, why can't I go there?"
"if this is what I think it is, it's not a place we should ever, ever take a little boy."
Then why is Diggs there?
Because it's his home forever.
"You know,  just because Diggs is a little different doesn't mean he's not a good person."
What would you know about friends like Diggs?
I have about eight of them.
So how do we fix him?
"Oh, Bart... Diggs' problems don't have easy fixes."
What kind of cheer-up talk is this?
Well... sometimes it helps to know people feel for you. Want a hug?
You hug the bedpost. Then I hug the bedpost. That way we never hug each other.
"Hey, Simpson. I heard bird boy got a new cage -- one with rubber bars."
"Yeah, and a rubber perch!"
"Yeah, yeah, and a..."
...rubber birdfeeder.
Making fun of the mentally ill. Real classy.
But you guys were...
"We were what, Captain Sensitive?"
The rumors of my bonkertude have been greatly exaggerated. D.S.M. Five indicates paranoid schizophrenia. But that work is mired in controversy. Mired.
I knew you'd escape! Were you carried out by a flock of falcons?
I got a one-day pass.
Were falcons involved in any way?
"I obtained the pass to enter the Springfield Falconry Contest, which is what Freedom and I were training for when we first met you."
"Great. Before anything else, let me just get closer to the door and say ""how crazy are you""?"
I'm fine. My meds won't wear off till tonight. Then I'll have Freedom tear you to shreds.
"No offense, but when a crazy guy pretends to be crazy, it's not funny."
You're discounting all talk radio.
"Fly my pet! Fly! Yes! Yes, now back to papa! Yes."
Why am I not surprised the only sport you do is one where a bird brings you food?
A falcon's greatest joy is to serve its master.
Once again I must point out you are not a parrot.
Fatso! Fatso! Pees in the shower!
"We're up next. When Freedom hits the air, you and I open all the cages."
Um... with our minds?
"No! With this rope! I'm a messed-up kid, I'm not Magneto."
Diggs and Freedom!
"""In his ecstasy! Then off, off forth on swing!"""
Where's my bird going?!
Wherever he wants. He's free now.
"If you see the stork what brings us babies, kill it!"
Now  I'm afraid one-day passes don't last forever. And I'm probably not going to get another one for quite a while.
Wait. When will I see you? You can't quit the falconry club!
"It's all yours, Mr. President."
"Well, I guess some delicate birds are safer in a cage."
"I had thought of it as a therapeutic milieu, but now ""cage"" is stuck in my head, so thanks. And thanks for being my friend."
"when I pushed you away, I was really pushing away the thought of losing you."
How long did it take you to think that up?
Two hours with the therapist.
She came in on a Saturday. Missed her kid's karate demonstration. He was goin' up a belt.
"Mom, you didn't cook the falcon?!"
Of course not. It's just duck.
"Pass the peas, please."
"Neptune. Eighth planet from the sun. A mystery now, we hope to have close-up photos from Voyager Two in Nineteen eighty-nine."
"We do have them! They're my home screen! Miss Hoover! Once again, the lesson plan I prepared would've covered this topic much better, but I can see..."
"It's Tuesday, Lisa. Taco Tuesday."
Taco Tuesday! Taco Tuesday!
Oh no! I'm about to become another moppin' statistic!
"There's only room for one of us, Ethel."
"that's your sixth taco. You know, Whitman says, ""If anything is sacred, the human body is sacred""."
"Congratulations, boys, you made it through another Taco Tuesday. Back in the bucket till next week."
Won't those vegetables go bad?
Nope. They're genetically modified to stay fresh. Just don't ask how old the Jell-O is.
"Overreactor dot org warns that over half of the vegetables sold in this country are ""Genetically Modified Organisms,"" whose effect on humans is... unknown!"
"Whoa! Mom, you made me over-swipe!"
Your parent's credit card has been charged twenty dollars!
"I have to get to the church. Helen Lovejoy is posting the spring volunteer signup sheet. In five minutes, every good task will be taken! Dang it!"
Jasper Beardley! You'll never make it!
"Bake sale -- taken... candle snuffing -- taken... baby shusher, miscellaneous choir support -- everything's taken! All that's left is..."
Teen abstinence counseling! You get to pass out abstinence pledges and make sure the kids sign their John Han-bleeps.
"But Ned, saying nay is your thing."
Not this month! Edna signed us up for a tango class. It was the only way I could avert wine tasting.
"Look, I'm really not comfortable talking about S-E-X with K-I-D-S."
Mom... can I visit Bob?
"Oh, it's not that hard. Just tell them that God wants them to ignore everything in their bodies that God is making happen."
We took the pledge!
We won't have sex until we're married.
To each other.
Their skipping lessons are really payin' off!
"Hello. Hello. I'm-I'm Marge Simpson. And I'm here to talk about a-a-a wonderful, beautiful thing--"
"Speaking of beautiful things, tongue me, babe."
"How many of you are here for the free cookies, because we've discontinued that."
One of our brightest and most meddlesome students called this meeting... somehow... to discuss an urgent menu matter. Lisa?
Our school cafeteria is serving G.M.O.s -- genetically-modified organisms.
"And now in order to thoroughly explore the issue, I'd like to play the first video that came up in my web browser when I typed in ""G.M.O."" plus ""danger"" plus ""question mark""."
"If there's one thing scientists love it's money. Money, money, money! And that's been true of scientists ever since caveman times."
"We need look no further back than the ancient Mayans, who cross-bred plants and animals in an unholy experiment in what is now a resort that charges thirty dollars a night to valet park."
"Once you're there, they've gotcha."
The Mayans didn't listen... to themselves.
"Yet, today, we toy with our fate by using retroviruses to create these so-called ""super foods"". Are we doomed to repeat an event that destroyed all human life? The answer is in your mouth."
Um... that video seemed a little... unscientific.
"My name is Jenny McCarthy, and I endorse this tirade."
Oh my God! It's worse than I thought. Everybody wait here while I do some actual research. Nobody form any opinions while I'm gone.
"Well, hurry! We have no minds of our own!"
I say we do not categorically ban genetically modified organisms.
"Well, G.M.O.s are resistant to pests, disease, and drought. It's just possible that G.M.O.s can actually end world hunger!"
I say let's get these G.M.O.s inside our children! Pronto!
Way ahead of you!
"I'm eating the food of the future. Beep, boop. What is... love? Boop, beep, boop."
I'd like to thank you for mollifying these land apes. We'd like you and your family to visit us at the Monsarno research campus.
"Ooh, campus! Do you have a statue of the founder I can stick a funny hat on?"
"Simpsons, we're trying to change the world, one molecule at a time."
Sounds like that would take a while.
"Oh, you're right. Everyone, three molecules at a time."
"I'll be home late, honey. Yeah, three molecules now."
"Well, it's nice to see for once a corporation that does good work and cares about people."
"Yes,  we've finally put to bed the silly notion that our company is in any way evil. Now, say hello to our Chief Scientist!"
Doctor Sideshow Bob.
Real doctor or PhD?
All right. I'll leave you and Bob in this locked room to get reacquainted.
"Simpsons, there's no need for alarm."
That's not for you to suck!
"Now, where was I? Right, no need to worry. I'm still technically shawshanking it at Springfield Penitentiary."
This is getting boring. Either murder us or tell us how you got here.
The inanity of the vanity license plate puns was slowly driving me mad.
"So when Monsarno Labs asked for experimental subjects, I gladly volunteered."
My job was to make sure the experiments wouldn't be too painful for the test monkeys.
I don't know what we're doin' here. We'll pick it up after lunch.
I wrote up my results and went from subject to scientist.
Look at me! I'm Sideshow Bob!
Foolish boy! That's phosphoric acid!
A mere sip would've dissolved a hole in your stomach the size of a silver dollar!
"Yakety, yakety, yak."
"""The spotted hawk accuses me, he complains of my gab."""
"""I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable""... Walt Whitman, ""Leaves of Grass""."
Very good.  you always were the one rose petal floating atop the cesspool that is the Simpsons.
/ That's mean.
"If you're done, our chief scientist has to get back to work. Our corn on the cob has become self-aware."
Wait! Wait! Won't you visit me again? Let me show you I really am trying to make a better world.  we can talk Walt Whitman... And  I think you'd enjoy the company of the campus's lazy overfed squirrels.
Overfed? I don't know this word.
"Visit me, Lisa. We can discuss poetry, fine art, and if we must, jazz."
Why would you want to do that? He's tried to kill us.
"You. He's tried to kill you. Me, I think he likes."
And I refuse to concede a mind that thinks so much like mine can be all bad. Mom?
Don't you think the parts that aren't evil are a little pretentious?
Absolutely. We're talking about  right?
This is the pinnacle of conversation around here.
Fine. I'll take you. They have this cool psych class at the campus I sat in on.
That was a sexual harassment seminar!
It doesn't matter. I'm taking it pass-fail.
"Blowing off steam in the crafts room, Marge?"
"No! I'm not giving up on reaching those kids, and I might just have a secret weapon."
Mm hmm. Is it finger puppets?
"Well, we haven't had finger puppets in this church since Reverend Brogan was arrested."
But I suppose enough time has passed.
And that's why Nancy No is the most popular girl in Promiseville High.
I prefer the modern thinking of Yolanda Yes.
And I think I'd have a shot with Mabel Maybe.
I am so tired of those kids sniggering.
"Uh-oh. It's Horndog Hank. Well, Nancy knows how to keep him away."
"Darn it, they're stuck."
"Um, can I take one of those girl puppets home? I won't do nothin' to it."
YOU SAY MODIFIED TO-MAY-TO / I SAY MODIFIED TO-MAH-TO...
I SAY ENGINEERED PO-TAY-TO / YOU SAY ENGINEERED PO-TAH-TO... POTATO!
LET'S SPLICE SOME D.N.A.!
That is my first non-evil laugh in years.
"Bob, there's one thing I've gotta know: are you plotting revenge?"
"I don't plot revenge anymore. It's like love: if it happens, it happens. Now, how 'bout those s'mores?"
You already ate all the chocolate bars.
That's why I've got to get the marshmallows down fast.
I like how they cut them down from a hundred and forty characters to a more manageable twenty characters.
"Another seminar tomorrow. I just wish I could connect with those teenagers, since it seems like we'll never have any."
teens can't control their urges. It's why there's never been a teenage President.
Are you saying I'm wasting my time?
"No. I'm saying you're wasting everyone's time. But it's a church thing, so that's a given."
Well then maybe I need to give those kids a better example. Goodnight!
"Shut your eyes, they're too bright."
"Kids, today we have a very special guest -- my husband."
"I brought Homer here to show that we can, and have, abstained for two whole days."
Two days? That's all?
